### Day 74: May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my portfolio once more. I fixed the css and now the footer and the compnents are being displayed properly. I need to find some references to see what I want to add to my portfolio website.

**Thoughts**: It's hard to find a project that I feel good about and it's the right stretch for my abilities. I will problably implement an old school project or find something that uses an easy API.

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my secret project. I created the projeto and equipe services for the project and fixed the routing for a component. 

**Thoughts**: It's been slow days but I deserve to take a bit slower for a bit due to life lol. I will be going back on the two last project to make them prettier. Just to say I love the intention of the 100 projects in a 100 days challenge because you can learn a lot with the time restraint and creating things on your own so I must make time for it at some point in 2020.

**Today's Progress**: I worked on project #2 from the 100 Days a 100 project. It's not very good but it's functional. tomorrow I will go back to the first two and give them a good refactoring. I think it's not the right time to start this challenge if I'm struggling that much on day 2. 

**Thoughts**: What should I do ? I like the idea but I think I can't do the walking if you know what I mean.

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my portifolio project and I worked on the navbar and the homepage. I also worked on the Random MV Generator (Random Meal Generator by Florin Pop).

**Thoughts**: I want to do the 100 projects in 100 days project but I don't feel prepared. lol I feel that it's a bit too much for me so I will take the next days to see what it would be like and think about the projects I want to work on in the challenge.

---

### Day 62: May 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my secret project. I worked on the home page, more on how to display the content itself than on JS. I had a lot of problem today trying to install bootstrap on a angular project. I think it has something to do with the fact that I have material already in it but not really sure.

**Thoughts**: I have to get back to the Angular course. Today was fun to dabble on this project and take a break from Udemy.
I want to start a writing course on udemy but I don't seem to bring myself to do it.

### Day 61: May 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my secret project. I created the navbar and started working a little on some the css and the routing.

**Thoughts**: I was more productive than I expected. It is indeed more fun to work on a project than just following a course or something.

### Day 60: April 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on section 2 of Angular - The Complete Guide. I also added the components to my new secret project, I will start implementing them soon and I hope it doesn't take me much time.

**Thoughts**: To be honest I'm in a slump but I am trying to fight back with some productivity and doing the usual but I can't get a hold of doing more than that.

**Today's Progress**: Finished section 8. Worked on examples about writable and readable streams and how to use the pipe function to handle them.

**Thoughts**: In May there is gonna be a challenge or a coding thing by Mayuko (youtuber) and I'm considering to partake in it but I don't want to commit to something I won't be able to keep up. Today I also started a writing course. I want to become better at writing in general and I've been writing scripts to possible future videos on my youtube videos.

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on section 5. Implemented a chat server using sockets and learned how to use the DNS module, UDP datagram sockets. I also started section 6, which is about Node for Web.

**Thoughts**: I started this course a bit skeptical about what it could teach me and how the course was showing me the content but it turns out it is a great course and it's very informative. I will for sure buy another Node course but I feel I have a better understand already of what Node can do for me.

**Today's Progress**: I finished section 4. Learned/ Reviewed about Promise, Event Emitters and Async functions. There are a lot of examples to help you understand the concepts.

**Thoughts**: I don't like examples in general, I find them to be very code-y (whatever this means).

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/advanced-nodejs-pluralsight/commit/9448d303b7a4ac6aad27b21ad8e3074e2f70e92d)

---


### Day 48: April 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished section 2 and 3 on Pluralsight. I've been following the examples to understand these advanced concepts. Now I'm working on the Node Event-driven Architecture section.

**Thoughts**: It's a different course than I expected it's very theoretical. I find the examples a bit too abstract but I like this course pace.

### Day 47: April 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked a bit on the Node.js course on Pluralsight and I worked on my portfolio project in Angular.

---

### Day 46: April 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finsihed the MEAN course on Udemy. it's very rewarding to finish another one, I personally have a LOT of courses to go through. I started the Advanced Node.js on Pluralsight and I hope I can learn Node more in depth.

**Thoughts**:  I could basically say the same thing about what I said yesterday but now I don't even have internet connectin to begin with. I coded today using my mobile data. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/kaio-rosa-angular-website/commit/072524e95fecd4e7f5b89d2418a71d7f8ed7b952)

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. Finished section 9 and 10. This last section was about displaying better error messages to the user and improving the user experience of the mean app. I still have a few sections to finish but I believe I'm very close to finsishing this course.

**Thoughts**: I love days when I get to be productive from the get go. I woke up earlier than usual did my habits and all that good stuff and now I'm about to start working from home (my internship) and I will have a free relaxed time when I get off from work mode. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/mean-stack-udemy/commit/19ddc85585c280404bee74144a3d7e7f2cd98049)

---

### Day 43: April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. Worked on section 9. I started implementing the authorization part of the application, I added the creator property to the post so we can manage who can edit and delete it later.

---

### Day 41: April 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I worked on section 8. Added the auth-interceptor.ts to the project and adjust the headers to accept the Authorization header as well. Also adjust a bit the UI according to the user status.  

**Thoughts**: This part of the course is dragging me a bit but I also think it's because I'm a bit stressed with everything that is happening plus not having work-life balance and not only being my fault. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/mean-stack-udemy/commit/9a1108508cdf3d9c0821ee9806443b097656ec1d)

---

### Day 40: April 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I worked on section 8. I worked on the /login route in the backend and then I added the jsonjwtwebtoken package to help me setup the jwt token when the user logs in. 

**Thoughts**: I'm learning how to use a jwt token to authenticate the user and the whole process of authentication and it's a bit complicated but it's fun as well. I'm almost in the middle of this section 8. It's definitely one of the most dense ones but it's super duper important to take my time in it.

### Day 37: April 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I worked on section 8. Worked on handling the user input and in the signup page.

**Thoughts**: Today I woke up late and it was only down hill from there. I hate days like that but tomorrow I will try to wake up earlier and try to organize myself better I feel like I have very limited time to work on my things lately and it is true but with better time management skills I can learn how to use better and more efficient my time, I want to accomplish so much and it seems to not have enough hours in the day.

### Day 33: April 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I worked on section 6. I'm still working on the image upload thingy cuz it's harder than I thought.

**Thoughts**: Image upload is not as fun as it sounds. TGIF lol. I'm just kidding but at the same time I am not.

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/mean-stack-udemy/commit/93cddf27ddbfada417aff7dd933c5ebba3cb2ef6)

---

### Day 32: April 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I worked on section 6. I worked on the image upload functionality, now I need to style the image preview and continue learning about the file validator and whatnot.

**Thoughts**: I'm 50% through my Udemy course. And it has been even a month since I started It's very exciting. I take back when I said the course was a bit vanilla cause it's not. We already when through the basics of the MEAN stack and now we are diving to more advanced and exciting stuff.

### Day 30: March 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I worked on the Edit feature on the Post component. (yes it took me an hour).

**Thoughts**: I'm happy with the progress that I've been making in this course. I should be done with it by less than a month I guess. I took a break with my Docker course and my Learning how to learn because to be honest I don't have much energy to do all them and I'm content with what I'm accomplishing with only one. I hope in the future I'm able to manage better my time since I still have IC stuff to do this week.

### Day 28: March 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. Finished Section 4. Worked on CRUD for Posts on the application.

**Thoughts**: It was a very productive day! I advanced a lot on the Udemy course and I've been having a lot of ideas to work on project-wise. I would love for connect my FrameWeb work with my JS journey but this is me rambling.

### Day 27: March 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. Finished Section 3 and started learning/reviewing about MongoDB basics. 

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying this course because the need for the other parts of the MEAN stack comes naturally which helps you understand why we are using certain technology but at the same time I feel that the project could be more complex. Maybe it's too early to say.

### Day 26: March 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I connected my angular project to a node backend and tested the features I implemeneted. I've learned about CORS and how to use HttpClientModule on Angular.

**Thoughts**: One of those unproductive days only I did the bare minimum but at least I continued with the challenge. It's funny that I allow myself having days like this without feeling like shit (not always but today I did).

### Day 25: March 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I started the section about NodeJS. I started a server and added express to it. I learned the difference betweeen a container and a image and learned some Docker commands and answered a quiz.

**Thoughts**: I think I need a more extensive course on NodeJS. I will be looking for the that in the next few days. This MEAN course is very superficial about the stack but I've been learning a lot. I have a more comprehensive course on Angular but I don't have one on Mongo and NodeJS. I also want to understand more about Docker and Kubernetes so I can undertand better what the fuss is about.

### Day 17: March 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. Continued working on section 2. 

**Thoughts**: I'm finding the MEAN course a bit boring but I will continue working on it. I think it's because I'm feeling overly confidend with my Angular skills. I need to take it down a notch!!! I know I have a lot to learn but the basics is something that I already feel comfortable.

### Day 13: March 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the cartao-virtual project. I adjusted the navbar and added the relevant info to the card. I also worked on the icons and the button in this project. I love how simple is to use Angular Material.

**Thoughts**: I bought a new Angular course today I'm so excited to start it and learn as much as I can. I'm very excited to apply everything I learn in my internship. What a great time to be alive. (lol) To future Kaio, this is reference to something I saw in Modern family. and I know it is used in other context but I'm refering to that.

### Day 12: March 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the cartao-virtual project. Added Modules and tested the examples from the documentation. I want to create a virtual business card (something within these lines) and I see that Angular Material has a lot icons and stuning navbars so I think it will be relatively easy to create this project. 

**Thoughts**: I'm just waiting the next Udemy promo so I can buy a Angular Masterclass or something. I'm also interested in learning about Socket.IO. As far as I understand emits something and uses TCP to work. I can be deadly wrong, you can laugh about it Kaio from the future.

---

### Day 8: March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on refactoring the existing code and adding / designing the shopping-cart db. I haven't gone very far because I feel that I'm over my head with this project but I'll keep going because it has a lot of potential for learning.

**Thoughts**: Continue investing time in the french podcast. I had a surprise on my linkedin that I feel bittersweet about and it was an unusual day in general.

### Day 7: March 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I continued working on the ProductQuantity component. I added some conditional statements so the product component show only when there are more than one product in the cart. I worked on the Cart and Product service adding changes relevant to product.

**Thoughts**: I found a french podcast and it's awesome I'm very happy with my progress with this language that I've been learning for so long without seeing any progress. About Angular I will find a course so I can learn more about Rxjs and all that good stuff. I find Angular very interesting and I hope I can learn a lot about it as well. A MEAN course. maybe?

### Day 5: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCart model. I added and fix the ShoppingCartItem. I'm putting off for a bit working on the service because I need more time to rethink It's such a mess and I don't want to work on it for today.

**Thoughts**: Feeling so good about my internship I hope everything goes well.

### Day 4: March 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCartService. I created a ShoppingCartItem to help modularize the products added in the cart and then I worked a bit on the updating the quantity.

**Thoughts**: Tired but satisfied with my day (sort of).

### Day 3: March 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCartService. I'm still trying to figure out a good way to store the product and its quantity but now I think I got a way. Now I have to come up with a way of updating a value that is on the db. I know this problems are not very hard to tackle but I'm only working on this project an hour a day so it's taking a bit more time. 

**Thoughts**: I'm sort of happy that now I don't have a partial report to finish but at the same time I don't feel good about my results at the moment, being honest I'm very tired of having to have this schedule if you know what I mean. Anyway it's my current state so I have to suck it up and deal with it.

---

### Day 2: March 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCartService. 
I'm working on the shoppingCart template and it's not looking good, I am very confused with what should go in a shoppingCart and what is better as a product alone. I probably don't make sense but quantity of a product is relevant to the cart or to the product or even both. I think it's both but how to properly do it without being repetitive. 

**Thoughts**: A veeery slow and tiring day!

### Day 1: March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCartService. 
I am implementing the addToCart function and designing how the shoppingCart component should look like in the db.

**Thoughts**: I must be crazy I never seem to stop my crave for consistency!
