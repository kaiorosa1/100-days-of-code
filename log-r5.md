# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 5) 


### Day 54: April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished section 8. Worked on examples about writable and readable streams and how to use the pipe function to handle them.

**Thoughts**: In May there is gonna be a challenge or a coding thing by Mayuko (youtuber) and I'm considering to partake in it but I don't want to commit to something I won't be able to keep up. Today I also started a writing course. I want to become better at writing in general and I've been writing scripts to possible future videos on my youtube videos.

### Day 53: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished section 7 and worked on section 8, which is about working with streams.

**Thoughts**: I can't lie, I'm way being excited for the new KATIE's single to care about other thing. Today was a filler day! (I hope the single is as good as I feel it will be)

### Day 51: April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on section 5. Implemented a chat server using sockets and learned how to use the DNS module, UDP datagram sockets. I also started section 6, which is about Node for Web.

**Thoughts**: I started this course a bit skeptical about what it could teach me and how the course was showing me the content but it turns out it is a great course and it's very informative. I will for sure buy another Node course but I feel I have a better understand already of what Node can do for me.

### Day 49: April 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished section 4. Learned/ Reviewed about Promise, Event Emitters and Async functions. There are a lot of examples to help you understand the concepts.

**Thoughts**: I don't like examples in general, I find them to be very code-y (whatever this means).

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/advanced-nodejs-pluralsight/commit/9448d303b7a4ac6aad27b21ad8e3074e2f70e92d)

### Day 48: April 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished section 2 and 3 on Pluralsight. I've been following the examples to understand these advanced concepts. Now I'm working on the Node Event-driven Architecture section.

**Thoughts**: It's a different course than I expected it's very theoretical. I find the examples a bit too abstract but I like this course pace.

### Day 46: April 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finsihed the MEAN course on Udemy. it's very rewarding to finish another one, I personally have a LOT of courses to go through. I started the Advanced Node.js on Pluralsight and I hope I can learn Node more in depth.

**Thoughts**:  I could basically say the same thing about what I said yesterday but now I don't even have internet connectin to begin with. I coded today using my mobile data.

### Day 44: April 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. Finished section 9 and 10. This last section was about displaying better error messages to the user and improving the user experience of the mean app. I still have a few sections to finish but I believe I'm very close to finsishing this course.

**Thoughts**: I love days when I get to be productive from the get go. I woke up earlier than usual did my habits and all that good stuff and now I'm about to start working from home (my internship) and I will have a free relaxed time when I get off from work mode.

---

### Day 43: April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. Worked on section 9. I started implementing the authorization part of the application, I added the creator property to the post so we can manage who can edit and delete it later.

---

### Day 41: April 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I worked on section 8. Added the auth-interceptor.ts to the project and adjust the headers to accept the Authorization header as well. Also adjust a bit the UI according to the user status.  

**Thoughts**: This part of the course is dragging me a bit but I also think it's because I'm a bit stressed with everything that is happening plus not having work-life balance and not only being my fault. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/mean-stack-udemy/commit/9a1108508cdf3d9c0821ee9806443b097656ec1d)

### Day 40: April 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I worked on section 8. I worked on the /login route in the backend and then I added the jsonjwtwebtoken package to help me setup the jwt token when the user logs in. 

**Thoughts**: I'm learning how to use a jwt token to authenticate the user and the whole process of authentication and it's a bit complicated but it's fun as well. I'm almost in the middle of this section 8. It's definitely one of the most dense ones but it's super duper important to take my time in it.

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I worked on section 8. Worked on handling the user input and in the signup page.

**Thoughts**: Today I woke up late and it was only down hill from there. I hate days like that but tomorrow I will try to wake up earlier and try to organize myself better I feel like I have very limited time to work on my things lately and it is true but with better time management skills I can learn how to use better and more efficient my time, I want to accomplish so much and it seems to not have enough hours in the day.

### Day 32: April 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I worked on section 6. I worked on the image upload functionality, now I need to style the image preview and continue learning about the file validator and whatnot.

**Thoughts**: I'm 50% through my Udemy course. And it has been even a month since I started It's very exciting. I take back when I said the course was a bit vanilla cause it's not. We already when through the basics of the MEAN stack and now we are diving to more advanced and exciting stuff.

### Day 30: March 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I worked on the Edit feature on the Post component. (yes it took me an hour).

**Thoughts**: I'm happy with the progress that I've been making in this course. I should be done with it by less than a month I guess. I took a break with my Docker course and my Learning how to learn because to be honest I don't have much energy to do all them and I'm content with what I'm accomplishing with only one. I hope in the future I'm able to manage better my time since I still have IC stuff to do this week.

---

### Day 28: March 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. Finished Section 4. Worked on CRUD for Posts on the application.

**Thoughts**: It was a very productive day! I advanced a lot on the Udemy course and I've been having a lot of ideas to work on project-wise. I would love for connect my FrameWeb work with my JS journey but this is me rambling.

---

### Day 27: March 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. Finished Section 3 and started learning/reviewing about MongoDB basics. 

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying this course because the need for the other parts of the MEAN stack comes naturally which helps you understand why we are using certain technology but at the same time I feel that the project could be more complex. Maybe it's too early to say.

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/mean-stack-udemy/commit/67e8df73aad15daa363327411592cf2ee0304c8d)

---

### Day 26: March 27, 2020

**Thoughts**: One of those unproductive days only I did the bare minimum but at least I continued with the challenge. It's funny that I allow myself having days like this without feeling like shit (not always but today I did).

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/mean-stack-udemy/commit/7ef89fa65f8a438113b5dd13b2ad16981013ea2f)

---

### Day 25: March 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I started the section about NodeJS. I started a server and added express to it. I learned the difference betweeen a container and a image and learned some Docker commands and answered a quiz.

**Thoughts**: I think I need a more extensive course on NodeJS. I will be looking for the that in the next few days. This MEAN course is very superficial about the stack but I've been learning a lot. I have a more comprehensive course on Angular but I don't have one on Mongo and NodeJS. I also want to understand more about Docker and Kubernetes so I can undertand better what the fuss is about.

### Day 24: March 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I added a postsService to my project and then I injected that into some components. Reviewed about Observables and Subjects and a bit about lifecycle hooks. 

**Thoughts**: I'm trying to create mini goals so I can finish my Udemy courses. I want to learn about a lot of things so I need to start finishing more courses.

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy.Changed the app component, added input and output to add posts using a event emitter. I also started downloading Docker on linux. I'm following the Docker Mastery course on Udemy and the tutorial is a bit long.

**Thoughts**: What is the key to being productive? I need to find out what works for me.

---

### Day 22: March 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy.I finished the post-create component, worked on the navbar and the post-list components and I reviewed Event Emitters.

**Thoughts**: I was able to buy a new charger and now I can work in my computer without much effort. I would love to buy a new computer because this remote work is proving that a fast computer is not a luxury but a need, either way I have been trying to focus and work and not spiral into the chaos we are currently living.

### Day 20: March 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I continued making my project prettier with the material components. I will be finishing up the section 2 soon.

**Thoughts**: Not very productive. I still want to spend more time with the udemy classes instead of fixing bugs.

### Day 17: March 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. Continued working on section 2. 

**Thoughts**: I'm finding the MEAN course a bit boring but I will continue working on it. I think it's because I'm feeling overly confidend with my Angular skills. I need to take it down a notch!!! I know I have a lot to learn but the basics is something that I already feel comfortable.

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/mean-stack-udemy/commit/b88d094d7fa140a3b6eb209a8f3eecf5ccb65152)

### Day 16: March 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. Worked on section 2. I also started learning about Docker from the Docker Mastery course (Section 1).

**Thoughts**: Started learning about Docker. I have a lot, when I say a lot means a lot, to learn about it. I don't even know what a container means per se, but I believe the course I bought is a good one and I can learn so much from it.

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. Watched some lectures on Udemy and worked on the mean-course app. 

**Thoughts**: A bought a course on Docker and I'm very exicted to learn about container and all that good stuff. I'm not changing my focus I just want to diversify what I am learning. I have a lot of school work to do as well.

### Day 14: March 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started the MEAN course on Udemy. I set up Angular and worked on the mean-course project.

**Thoughts**: I hope I learn a lot about the MEAN stack. Although I have a basic undertanding of it I want to be able to have a better picture of everything.

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/mean-stack-udemy/commit/86df5121fbc638450ed7f2cc839adac963c30113)

### Day 13: March 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the cartao-virtual project. I adjusted the navbar and added the relevant info to the card. I also worked on the icons and the button in this project. I love how simple is to use Angular Material.

**Thoughts**: I bought a new Angular course today I'm so excited to start it and learn as much as I can. I'm very excited to apply everything I learn in my internship. What a great time to be alive. (lol) To future Kaio, this is reference to something I saw in Modern family. and I know it is used in other context but I'm refering to that.

---

### Day 12: March 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the cartao-virtual project. Added Modules and tested the examples from the documentation. I want to create a virtual business card (something within these lines) and I see that Angular Material has a lot icons and stuning navbars so I think it will be relatively easy to create this project. 

**Thoughts**: I'm just waiting the next Udemy promo so I can buy a Angular Masterclass or something. I'm also interested in learning about Socket.IO. As far as I understand emits something and uses TCP to work. I can be deadly wrong, you can laugh about it Kaio from the future.

### Day 11: March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the cartao-virtual project. It's a new project just to practice what I've been learning about Angular Material. 

**Thoughts**: I want to become so good in Angular so I can do any project in it.

### Day 8: March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on refactoring the existing code and adding / designing the shopping-cart db. I haven't gone very far because I feel that I'm over my head with this project but I'll keep going because it has a lot of potential for learning.

**Thoughts**: Continue investing time in the french podcast. I had a surprise on my linkedin that I feel bittersweet about and it was an unusual day in general.

### Day 7: March 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I continued working on the ProductQuantity component. I added some conditional statements so the product component show only when there are more than one product in the cart. I worked on the Cart and Product service adding changes relevant to product.

**Thoughts**: I found a french podcast and it's awesome I'm very happy with my progress with this language that I've been learning for so long without seeing any progress. About Angular I will find a course so I can learn more about Rxjs and all that good stuff. I find Angular very interesting and I hope I can learn a lot about it as well. A MEAN course. maybe?

### Day 6: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ProductQuantity. I finally added to the ProductCard Component.

### Day 5: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCart model. I added and fix the ShoppingCartItem. I'm putting off for a bit working on the service because I need more time to rethink It's such a mess and I don't want to work on it for today.

**Thoughts**: Feeling so good about my internship I hope everything goes well.

### Day 4: March 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCartService. I created a ShoppingCartItem to help modularize the products added in the cart and then I worked a bit on the updating the quantity.

### Day 3: March 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCartService. I'm still trying to figure out a good way to store the product and its quantity but now I think I got a way. Now I have to come up with a way of updating a value that is on the db. I know this problems are not very hard to tackle but I'm only working on this project an hour a day so it's taking a bit more time. 

**Thoughts**: I'm sort of happy that now I don't have a partial report to finish but at the same time I don't feel good about my results at the moment, being honest I'm very tired of having to have this schedule if you know what I mean. Anyway it's my current state so I have to suck it up and deal with it.

### Day 2: March 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCartService. 
I'm working on the shoppingCart template and it's not looking good, I am very confused with what should go in a shoppingCart and what is better as a product alone. I probably don't make sense but quantity of a product is relevant to the cart or to the product or even both. I think it's both but how to properly do it without being repetitive. 

**Thoughts**: A veeery slow and tiring day!

### Day 1: March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCartService. 
I am implementing the addToCart function and designing how the shoppingCart component should look like in the db.

**Thoughts**: I must be crazy I never seem to stop my crave for consistency!
