### Day 24: March 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. I added a postsService to my project and then I injected that into some components. Reviewed about Observables and Subjects and a bit about lifecycle hooks. 

**Thoughts**: I'm trying to create mini goals so I can finish my Udemy courses. I want to learn about a lot of things so I need to start finishing more courses.

### Day 23: March 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy.Changed the app component, added input and output to add posts using a event emitter. I also started downloading Docker on linux. I'm following the Docker Mastery course on Udemy and the tutorial is a bit long.

### Day 22: March 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy.I finished the post-create component, worked on the navbar and the post-list components and I reviewed Event Emitters.

**Thoughts**: I was able to buy a new charger and now I can work in my computer without much effort. I would love to buy a new computer because this remote work is proving that a fast computer is not a luxury but a need, either way I have been trying to focus and work and not spiral into the chaos we are currently living.

### Day 17: March 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued the MEAN course on Udemy. Continued working on section 2. 

**Thoughts**: I'm finding the MEAN course a bit boring but I will continue working on it. I think it's because I'm feeling overly confidend with my Angular skills. I need to take it down a notch!!! I know I have a lot to learn but the basics is something that I already feel comfortable.

**Thoughts**: Started learning about Docker. I have a lot, when I say a lot means a lot, to learn about it. I don't even know what a container means per se, but I believe the course I bought is a good one and I can learn so much from it.

### Day 13: March 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the cartao-virtual project. I adjusted the navbar and added the relevant info to the card. I also worked on the icons and the button in this project. I love how simple is to use Angular Material.

**Thoughts**: I bought a new Angular course today I'm so excited to start it and learn as much as I can. I'm very excited to apply everything I learn in my internship. What a great time to be alive. (lol) To future Kaio, this is reference to something I saw in Modern family. and I know it is used in other context but I'm refering to that.

### Day 12: March 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the cartao-virtual project. Added Modules and tested the examples from the documentation. I want to create a virtual business card (something within these lines) and I see that Angular Material has a lot icons and stuning navbars so I think it will be relatively easy to create this project. 

**Thoughts**: I'm just waiting the next Udemy promo so I can buy a Angular Masterclass or something. I'm also interested in learning about Socket.IO. As far as I understand emits something and uses TCP to work. I can be deadly wrong, you can laugh about it Kaio from the future.

### Day 11: March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the cartao-virtual project. It's a new project just to practice what I've been learning about Angular Material. 

**Thoughts**: I want to become so good in Angular so I can do any project in it.

---

### Day 8: March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on refactoring the existing code and adding / designing the shopping-cart db. I haven't gone very far because I feel that I'm over my head with this project but I'll keep going because it has a lot of potential for learning.

**Thoughts**: Continue investing time in the french podcast. I had a surprise on my linkedin that I feel bittersweet about and it was an unusual day in general.

### Day 7: March 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I continued working on the ProductQuantity component. I added some conditional statements so the product component show only when there are more than one product in the cart. I worked on the Cart and Product service adding changes relevant to product.

**Thoughts**: I found a french podcast and it's awesome I'm very happy with my progress with this language that I've been learning for so long without seeing any progress. About Angular I will find a course so I can learn more about Rxjs and all that good stuff. I find Angular very interesting and I hope I can learn a lot about it as well. A MEAN course. maybe?

### Day 6: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ProductQuantity. I finally added to the ProductCard Component.

### Day 5: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCart model. I added and fix the ShoppingCartItem. I'm putting off for a bit working on the service because I need more time to rethink It's such a mess and I don't want to work on it for today.

**Thoughts**: Feeling so good about my internship I hope everything goes well.

---

### Day 4: March 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCartService. I created a ShoppingCartItem to help modularize the products added in the cart and then I worked a bit on the updating the quantity.

**Thoughts**: Tired but satisfied with my day (sort of).

---

### Day 3: March 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCartService. I'm still trying to figure out a good way to store the product and its quantity but now I think I got a way. Now I have to come up with a way of updating a value that is on the db. I know this problems are not very hard to tackle but I'm only working on this project an hour a day so it's taking a bit more time. 

**Thoughts**: I'm sort of happy that now I don't have a partial report to finish but at the same time I don't feel good about my results at the moment, being honest I'm very tired of having to have this schedule if you know what I mean. Anyway it's my current state so I have to suck it up and deal with it.

---

### Day 2: March 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCartService. 
I'm working on the shoppingCart template and it's not looking good, I am very confused with what should go in a shoppingCart and what is better as a product alone. I probably don't make sense but quantity of a product is relevant to the cart or to the product or even both. I think it's both but how to properly do it without being repetitive. 

**Thoughts**: A veeery slow and tiring day!

---

### Day 1: March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Angular application. I worked on the ShoppingCartService. 
I am implementing the addToCart function and designing how the shoppingCart component should look like in the db.

**Thoughts**: I must be crazy I never seem to stop my crave for consistency!
