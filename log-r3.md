# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 3) 


### Day 1: August 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I changed a bit my focus and started reviewing/learning C++. Is it called reviewing when you don't rememeber how to print something in the screen? lol. 

**Thoughts**: This round I'm gonna be focusing on my school so I'll probably be solving problems related to my classes and stuff I'm taking advantage of this habit to try to code for my school projects everyday. I obviously won't forget freeCodeCamp and web development but I'm taking a step back for a brief moment.

### Day 2: August 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed more C++ and I watched some C++ Tutorials.

**Thoughts**: Friday is always a day where I just wanna get home and sleep. Coding is fun and sometimes it's hard for me to not code.

### Day 3: August 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Exercise Tracker project (FCC). I finally finished the project. I love this feeling of finishing a project, it's very fulfulling and I love knowing that this feeling is constant in work-life. 

**Thoughts**: Today hasn't been as productive as I wanted but obviously I could do much more than I expected from a weekend.
