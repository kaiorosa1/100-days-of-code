# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 3) 


### Day 1: August 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I changed a bit my focus and started reviewing/learning C++. Is it called reviewing when you don't rememeber how to print something in the screen? lol. 

**Thoughts**: This round I'm gonna be focusing on my school so I'll probably be solving problems related to my classes and stuff I'm taking advantage of this habit to try to code for my school projects everyday. I obviously won't forget freeCodeCamp and web development but I'm taking a step back for a brief moment.

### Day 2: August 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed more C++ and I watched some C++ Tutorials.

**Thoughts**: Friday is always a day where I just wanna get home and sleep. Coding is fun and sometimes it's hard for me to not code.

### Day 3: August 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Exercise Tracker project (FCC). I finally finished the project. I love this feeling of finishing a project, it's very fulfulling and I love knowing that this feeling is constant in work-life. 

**Thoughts**: Today hasn't been as productive as I wanted but obviously I could do much more than I expected from a weekend.

---

### Day 4: August 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Today I reviewed and watch a bunch of C++ tutorials. I learned about templatize function in C++, which can be very useful to use instead of overloading function.  I also started the File Metadata Microservice project (FCC). 

**Thoughts**: C++ is very fun to code and I know I have my plate full in this semester. I want to be on top of all my classes I know it's gonna be hard but most of them involves code so I'll enjoy them a lot.

---

### Day 5: August 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**:   Today I worked on the File Metadata Microservice project (FCC). I started understanding what needs to be done and read the multer api and now it's a bit more clear but I still need to figure out how to continue the project. I also reviewed more C++.

**Thoughts**: I spent a lot of time on dual booting my machine it was a bit frustating but everything went fine. I'm feeling that I need to more delligent with my time because I have a lot of reading to do and I'm so far from getting close to meeting my reading goal per week and I would love to prioritize that in the next couple of days.

---

### Day 6: August 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I focused on C++ again and using linux. I've been refreshing how to use the terminal and how to setup git in my new repository for the next few days I'll be coding a project a did in java but in C++. Let's see how that goes.

**Thoughts**: Always tired but always wanting to get coding. To be honest I don't know how I code in days like this. Not an end of the semester day but I'm tired. I finished reading one research paper that I wanted though I'll figure out how to balance everything.

---

### Day 7: August 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I started the project in C++. I'm still learning the sysntax and I hope to start getting more confortable soon. I want to be coding in a C++ way if this makes sense. I created the classes and started refamiliarizing with that project.

**Thoughts**: Know it's official that I have a lot to do and I have to learn how to properly use my time. I don't know but today is a perfect example of how I don't see where my time going.

---

### Day 8: August 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Today I focused on C++ again. I worked on the SistemaPPGIC++ project.  I didn't code as much as I wanted. C++ syntax is being a bit hard for me to grasp.  I often don't know how to do things in the cpp way. For example I wanted to create a getter and a setter for an attribute but I moved the class definition to a .h file and I don't know anymore how to access the attribute. In my view I should be able to access it but apparent I'm not. When stuff like that happen I don't know if it's my C++ knowledge lacking or maybe it's something I'm really struggling. 

**Thoughts**:  I'm very excited to learn more about C++ and soon I'll be applying all of these knowledge in assignments.

---

### Day 9: August 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the SistemaPPGICPP project. I think I'm not have as much problems as I thought I would have. I created the getters and setters and I still have to think about some approaches on how to solve the problem at hand. C++ is a beautiful programming language. I say that until I start managing memory haha.

**Thoughts**:  How can I code everyday ? That is still a question I have haha. The power of habit huh?

---

### Day 10: August 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Credenciamento Project (aka SistemaPPGICPP). I started reading the input files and reading about how to do it in C++. I also watched more C++ tutorials.

**Thoughts**:  It's very hard to code when you don't have decent access to internet but I used my mobile data. Hopefully tomorrow my connection gets better because I don't think I have this much data to spare.

---

### Day 11: August 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Credenciamento Project (aka SistemaPPGICPP). Changed the Docente.h file and continued reading the docente.csv. Now I need to learn how to parse to the respective types properly. I also watched some C++ tuts.

**Thoughts**:  My internet sucks, period twice.

---

### Day 12: August 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Crecenciamento Project. I started parsing the values and I'm still not sure about how I'm handling dates in C++. It's very rudimental and I would hope it was easier but it's very C-like so it's cumbersome but I think I made it work. Now I'll be moving on and start reading other files so then I can focus on the funcionality which is quite simple for what I can remember.

**Thoughts**: I need to develop better habits lol.

---

### Day 13: August 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I set up OpenGL and opened my first program. There are a lot to learn but the important thing is that I could run it and now it's understanding time (the best part). I also worked on the Credenciamento project.

**Thoughts**: Can I ever be on top of all my classes ? I don't think so. Anyway, I have a project that's gonna be coming soon(I don't even know what it is because the professor hasn't assigned to us yet) hopefully I'll do well.

---

### Day 14: August 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I focus on working with C++. For the next couple of days or even weeks I'll be working on a school project.  I started working on my school project and  it seems to be good so far. I have to learn how to print a circle and then how to interact with it.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I was feeling the professor would assign us our first project and there it is. I still have little idea of how I'm going to approach it. Fighting.

---

### Day 15: August 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the school project again. I'm learning how to pring points on the screen how the camera works and all that. I found great OpenGL tutorials and it is in spanish so that good.

**Thoughts**: It was not a very good day I just want everything to over. I want the weeekend so I can spend all day at home and maybe I do something productive.

---

### Day 16: August 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my school project again. I've played around with the keyboard func and how to interact with the window and its objects. I've watched some OpenGL/GLUT tutorials in spanish. 

**Thoughts**: I want to use my 100DaysOfCode better but the last two days was almost impossible.

---

### Day 17: August 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the GLUT project and I mostly tested some code and watched some tutorials.

**Thoughts**: I could have been more productive but I was not intentionally maybe I'll regret it later but now I feel that I needed that "time off".

---


### Day 18: September 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the GLUT project again. I imported the TinyXml library to help me read the configuration of my program. I'm reading the documentation to help me do that. I'm a bit frustated why it took me this long to import a simple library.

**Thoughts**: So  many what ifs but I'll continuing doing what I can do. I won't let myself get overwhelmed I have a lot to do but I do one thing at a time.

---

### Day 19: September 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked more on TC1 project(I gave it a lot of names throughout this past week, lol). I'm reading the config file and getting the info I need. Next step is getting the mouse click function to work and draw a circle in the window.

**Thoughts**: I was very productive even though I was not forcing myself to do stuff. I hope days can be like this more often.

---

### Day 20: September 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked more on TC1 project. I read the config file from a different directory. 

**Thoughts**: I hate when it feels like I don't have enough time to do my things. I have an assignment due tomorrow that I haven't even started and this project that due at the end of this week. and I still believe I'll finish them on time but I have to cut time on sleeping.

---

### Day 21: September 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the TC1 project again. I watched a video and implemented the circle drawing and now  I have to learn how to implement interactivity.

**Thoughts**: I'm so tired today but I could learn how to draw a circle in and that's good this means that the basic functionality of the assignment is gonna be done.

---

### Day 23: September 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the TC1 project. I'm trying to print circle where I click with the mouse but no luck so far. 

**Thoughts**: Friday is always very tiring I have a lot on my shoulder but I need to sleep at the same time.

---

### Day 24: September 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the TC1 project. I divided the drawing into functions and now I'm dicovering how to display the functions where I intend them to be.

**Thoughts**: Procastination will cost me. This TC1 project is due tomorrow night and I still have a buttload to do. Fighting Kaio!!!

### Day 25: September 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the TC1 project. Now I'm displaying the circles where I want them to be. I still have to implement the drag and drop functionality. Hopefully I'll finish this project today!! 
PS: I made it work I was able to implement all of the functionality. Now I need to test it and make sure everything is right before sending it to the professor.

**Thoughts**: Last day to make it work. Thankfully things are going well but still a lot to do. It's very fulfulling to be able to solve problems. I'm on fire!! lol

### Day 26: September 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I started working on another project. let's call it CC1. I'm reading the specification and I need to start right way because the due date is next week already.

**Thoughts**: Another night another party as Ari Grande once said.

---

### Day 27: September 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I studied more about Flex. I read and ran some of the lab exercises. I just want time to breath I'm feeling a bit suffocated.

**Thoughts**: I'm surprised with how many ways I find to disappoint myself. It's not good for my mental health being me. F it. I will get over it soon I always do.

---

### Day 28: September 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I started reading the config file in the TC2 project. And also read the labs about flex and tiny and how the lexical analyzer work.

**Thoughts**: Not a very good day. Starting to spiraling down. Reading my last few days may seem that I'm depressed but I think it's more of being tired and needing time to recharge.

---

### Day 29: September 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the CC1 project and worked on the labs (meaning understanding them). 

**Thoughts**: Today I decided to make peace with the fact that I don't have much time for myself so I will try my best to embrace the suck. Things won't go my way and I have to find a way to accept that but more than that I should find a way to turn everything around. I know I can do better. I have so many plans and I wanna be able to do them.

---

### Day 30: September 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Today I worked on the CC1 project again. But now I know that the project is progressing if you know what I mean.

**Thoughts**: I was so tired that I almost thought I would last my streak. (Not really) Friday is always very cruel to me.

---

### Day 31: September 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Today I worked on the CC1 project again. I coded a bit more but I read the professor's slide notes because I need more conceptual knowledge before moving on. 

**Thoughts**: I need to become more disciplined I feel that I'm spending my time properly and doing to much self care for my own sake.
