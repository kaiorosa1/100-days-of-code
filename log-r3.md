# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 3) 


### Day 1: August 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I changed a bit my focus and started reviewing/learning C++. Is it called reviewing when you don't rememeber how to print something in the screen? lol. 

**Thoughts**: This round I'm gonna be focusing on my school so I'll probably be solving problems related to my classes and stuff I'm taking advantage of this habit to try to code for my school projects everyday. I obviously won't forget freeCodeCamp and web development but I'm taking a step back for a brief moment.

### Day 2: August 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed more C++ and I watched some C++ Tutorials.

**Thoughts**: Friday is always a day where I just wanna get home and sleep. Coding is fun and sometimes it's hard for me to not code.

### Day 3: August 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Exercise Tracker project (FCC). I finally finished the project. I love this feeling of finishing a project, it's very fulfulling and I love knowing that this feeling is constant in work-life. 

**Thoughts**: Today hasn't been as productive as I wanted but obviously I could do much more than I expected from a weekend.

### Day 4: August 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Today I reviewed and watch a bunch of C++ tutorials. I learned about templatize function in C++, which can be very useful to use instead of overloading function.  I also started the File Metadata Microservice project (FCC). 

**Thoughts**: C++ is very fun to code and I know I have my plate full in this semester. I want to be on top of all my classes I know it's gonna be hard but most of them involves code so I'll enjoy them a lot.

### Day 5: August 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**:   Today I worked on the File Metadata Microservice project (FCC). I started understanding what needs to be done and read the multer api and now it's a bit more clear but I still need to figure out how to continue the project. I also reviewed more C++.

**Thoughts**: I spent a lot of time on dual booting my machine it was a bit frustating but everything went fine. I'm feeling that I need to more delligent with my time because I have a lot of reading to do and I'm so far from getting close to meeting my reading goal per week and I would love to prioritize that in the next couple of days.

### Day 6: August 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I focused on C++ again and using linux. I've been refreshing how to use the terminal and how to setup git in my new repository for the next few days I'll be coding a project a did in java but in C++. Let's see how that goes.

**Thoughts**: Always tired but always wanting to get coding. To be honest I don't know how I code in days like this. Not an end of the semester day but I'm tired. I finished reading one research paper that I wanted though I'll figure out how to balance everything.

### Day 7: August 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I started the project in C++. I;m still learning the sysntax and I hope to start getting more confortable soon. I want to be coding in a C++ way if this makes sense. I created the classes and started refamiliarizing with that project.

**Thoughts**: Know it's official that I have a lot to do and I have to learn how to properly use my time. I don't know but today is a perfect example of how I don't see where my time going.
