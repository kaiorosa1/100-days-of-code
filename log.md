# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on HTML and CSS on FreeCodeCamp. Finished the HTML Section and did some subsection on the Intro to CSS module. I learned about string function on MySQL and review DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts**: This is a refresher for me at least for now. I decided that I''ll be following FreeCodeCamp's route. Technically it's been weeks that I started coding every day but I start counting for today. I'm studying JavaScript on Udemy and a bit of MySQL. I'm very excited with this challenge and I hope to see great progress in my web dev/coding in general skills.

### Day 2: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I progressed with freeCodeCamp. I finished the section about the CSS basics. I reviewed about margin, padding, hexadecimal and rgb system and CSS variables and importance of fallbacks when it comes to CSS styling. Started working on a minesweeper in C. I only started reading the files to generate the table.

**Thoughts**: It was a bit overwhelming to finish all the module even though it was almost like a review session. I'll try to put my study session as early as possible. Since I'm on vacation I'll be continuing coding but it was not going to be as structure as I intend with this callenge. I want to be working on projects I'm starting that today. It's only simple to-do list in JS. My intention with this challenge is advance as far as I can,resonably, in freeCodeCamp.

### Day 3: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued reading the file tabuleiro.txt from Campo Minado (minesweeper).I did a couple of challenges from  the Applied Visual Design on FCC (FreeCodeCamp).

**Thoughts**: I started differently since I only had 30 minutes to work on something I decided to go with the project I began yesterday. It's a minesweeper but a simplified version. My intention with this project is to finish it according to a specification (I'll propably talk more about that later on). in the 30 minutes left, I worked on some FCC challenges. I did a couple of the Applied Visual Design one and took some notes as I'm usually doing. I intend to separate a day only for review everything I've been learning.

### Day 4: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I used one hour to go through Free Code Camp. I stopped at : Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element (Applied Visual Design). I worked on Campo Minado for 30 minutes mainly focusing on designing the data structure I'm going to be using.

**Thoughts**: The challenges are more fun and I'm confident that my CSS skills are getting better. Right now I'm not couting watching Udemy tutorial as work towards the challenge but I eventually will since I don't just watch tutorial, I code along and take notes and try to do myself as much as I can and most tutorial that I watch have follow up exercises which I do as well.

### Day 5: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on some Free Code Camp challenges for an hour. I stopped at : Applied Visual Design: Animate Elements at Variable Rates (Applied Visual Design). Coded more on Campo Minado.

**Thoughts**: It's been a crazy day. I don't know why but I don't seem to get focused.Fortunately I worked an hour on free code camp. The first time on my project that I have to think twice about what I'm doing. that's what coding is about.

### Day 6: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on the design aspect of the Campo Minado, meaning in what type of fuctions and the paramenters and testing the functions I created so far. I've spent an hour creating functions like print and allocation memory and making sure it's working the way I intentionally designed them. Also finsihed the section about applied visual and design and worked on some sections on the next section. I stopped at : Applied Accessibility: Improve Chart Accessibility with the figure Element (Applied Accessibility).

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I started this challenge I'm feeling very productive and I'm learning a lot by coding my project and using FCC. I'm not finding FCC as challenging yet but I'm sure when the projects come along and I go further down the line I'll have my fair share of wondering why I choose programming in the first place. Just kidding! Am I?

### Day 7: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent 30 minutes on Campo Minado and changed a bit some functions.  I worked around 40 minutes on FCC and finished the Applied Accessibility module. I stopped at : Responsive Web Design Principles: Create a Media Query (Responsive Web Design Principles).

**Thoughts**: I felt the my first session was not very productive and I didn't go as far as I wanted. It's a bit buggy my code my that's what happens when you are programming, not all your code is good from the get go. I'm feeling that I'm not making a lot of progress on FCC as I thought I would but it's because I make sure I read everything and take notes carefully before moving on to the next challenge or maybe I'm slow (no worries) lol.

### Day 8: February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started and finsihed the Responsive Web Design Principles.  I stopped at: CSS Flexbox: Use display: flex to Position Two Boxes (CSS Flexbox).

**Thoughts**: I'm very excited that I'm two section to go to start working on project to apply everything I've learned so far. I'm also very excited to start working with CSS flexbox. I know I'm taking small steps towards finishing FCC but I think in this way I won't burn out quickly and I plan to start working more hours weeks from now. I hit a road block with Campo Minado and I have no idea how to solve the problem that I have so I'll use the rest of the time I planned searching and tweaking and coding. Good Luch to me!
