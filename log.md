# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on HTML and CSS on FreeCodeCamp. Finished the HTML Section and did some subsection on the Intro to CSS module. I learned about string function on MySQL and review DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts**: This is a refresher for me at least for now. I decided that I'll be following FreeCodeCamp's route. Technically it's been weeks that I started coding every day but I start counting for today. I'm studying JavaScript on Udemy and a bit of MySQL. I'm very excited about this challenge and I hope to see great progress in my web dev/coding in general skills.

**Link(s) to work**: None.

### Day 2: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I progressed with freeCodeCamp. I finished the section about the CSS basics. I reviewed about margin, padding, hexadecimal and RGB system and CSS variables and importance of fallbacks when it comes to CSS styling. Started working on a minesweeper in C. I only started reading the files to generate the table.

**Thoughts**: It was a bit overwhelming to finish all the module even though it was almost like a review session. I'll try to put my study session as early as possible. Since I'm on vacation I'll be continuing coding but it was not going to be as structured as I intend with this challenge. I want to be working on projects I'm starting that today. It's only a simple to-do list in JS. My intention with this challenge is to advance as far as I can, reasonably, in freeCodeCamp.

### Day 3: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued reading the file tabuleiro.txt from Campo Minado (minesweeper). I did a couple of challenges from the Applied Visual Design on FCC (FreeCodeCamp).

**Thoughts**: I started differently since I only had 30 minutes to work on something I decided to go with the project I began yesterday. It's a minesweeper but a simplified version. My intention with this project is to finish it according to a specification (I'll probably talk more about that later on). in the 30 minutes left, I worked on some FCC challenges. I did a couple of the Applied Visual Design one and took some notes as I'm usually doing. I intend to separate a day only to review everything I've been learning.

First, commit I made today: https://github.com/kaiorosa1/campo-minado/commit/dd680d025ab3b5b5bec7fe3bc21dec39ec5a31ff

---
### Day 4: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I used one hour to go through Free Code Camp. I stopped at Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element (Applied Visual Design). I worked on Campo Minado for 30 minutes mainly focusing on designing the data structure I'm going to be using.

**Thoughts**: The challenges are more fun and I'm confident that my CSS skills are getting better. Right now I'm not counting watching Udemy tutorial as work towards the challenge but I eventually will since I don't just watch the tutorial, I code along and take notes and try to do myself as much as I can and most tutorial that I watch have followed up exercises which I do as well.

---

### Day 5: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on some Free Code Camp challenges for an hour. I stopped at Applied Visual Design: Animate Elements at Variable Rates (Applied Visual Design). Coded more on Campo Minado.

**Thoughts**: It's been a crazy day. I don't know why but I don't seem to get focused. Fortunately, I worked an hour on free code camp. The first time on my project that I have to think twice about what I'm doing. that's what coding is about.

---

### Day 6: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on the design aspect of the Campo Minado, meaning in what type of functions and the parameters and testing the functions I created so far. I've spent an hour creating functions like print and allocation memory and making sure it's working the way I intentionally designed them. Also finished the section about applied visual and design and worked on some sections on the next section. I stopped at Applied Accessibility: Improve Chart Accessibility with the figure Element (Applied Accessibility).

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I started this challenge I'm feeling very productive and I'm learning a lot by coding my project and using FCC. I'm not finding FCC as challenging yet but I'm sure when the projects come along and I go further down the line I'll have my fair share of wondering why I choose programming in the first place. Just kidding! Am I?

---

### Day 7: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent 30 minutes on Campo Minado and changed a bit some functions.  I worked around 40 minutes on FCC and finished the Applied Accessibility module. I stopped at Responsive Web Design Principles: Create a Media Query (Responsive Web Design Principles).

**Thoughts**: I felt my first session was not very productive and I didn't go as far as I wanted. It's a bit buggy my code my that's what happens when you are programming, not all your code is good from the get-go. I'm feeling that I'm not making a lot of progress on FCC as I thought I would but it's because I make sure I read everything and take notes carefully before moving on to the next challenge or maybe I'm slow (no worries) lol.

---

### Day 8: February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished the Responsive Web Design Principles.  I stopped at: CSS Flexbox: Use display: flex to Position Two Boxes (CSS Flexbox). I worked on Campo Minado with not much progress. I try to change how I was reading from the file. I decided to copy the file first and then I was going to change the 1s and 0s to the bombs and empty places.

**Thoughts**: I'm very excited that I'm two sections to go to start working on a project to apply everything I've learned so far. I'm also very excited to start working with CSS flexbox. I know I'm taking small steps towards finishing FCC but I think in this way I won't burn out quickly and I plan to start working more hours weeks from now. I hit a roadblock with Campo Minado and I have no idea how to solve the problem that I have so I'll use the rest of the time I planned searching and tweaking and coding. Good Luck to me!

---

### Day 9: February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Campo Minado and I implemented a bunch of function. It's printing the table completely and I calculated the neighbors' bombs and everything. Worked as well on FCC problems for 30 minutes or so and I got back to Campo Minado and worked some more on implementing realizarJogada().

**Thoughts**: Through lots of researching and testing I found the bug and it was with allocating memory. It's always related to that when we are dealing with C. Feeling good about the progress I made and I worked for 2 hours + straight until I saw my progress flowing. Flexbox is very interesting and useful, I'm only at the beginning but I already like it.

---


### Day 10: February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished CSS Flexbox on FCC. It's much like reading the documentation. Mainly worked on the final design of the final table of Campo Minado.

**Thoughts**: I feel that I'll learn more when I get to the projects. The challenges are fun but it's more like testing and reading the documentation. I don't force myself to remember all those properties, I do take notes but I don't think I'll be able to remember everything I learned so far if I don't use it constanstly.

---


### Day 11: February 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the FCC section about CSS grid. It was fun and there is a phonebook of properties like the other CSS sections. CSS grid is an easier way to format your elements and a very useful tool to have when dealing with responsiveness. I worked on the flood fill functionality of the minesweeper on Campo Minado. 

**Thoughts**: It was fun to learn this last section and now I get to work on 5 projects and I'll start them tomorrow or maybe later today. Following my schedule, I'll work on Campo minado for a bit. I think I close to finishing Campo Minado. The flood fill function is not working a hundred percent but I'm confident enough that I can solve that by tomorrow. 

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github: https://github.com/kaiorosa1/campo-minado/commit/d646e8f4b53424aeed47b4a2ba29405016a35b91

---


### Day 12: February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the flood fill functionality of the Campo Minado with not much success. I worked on FCC Tribute Page. Mainly was creating a structure like divs and setting ids and changing colors of elements.

**Thoughts**: It's normal to get stuck I know but it sucks every time it happens. I'm struggling to understand what is wrong with my code. I know where the bug is but I don't know how to fix it yet. Later today I'll go back to it. I'm realizing that giving you this time constraint instead of a task one. It's been very refreshing and less frustrating than working for 4 hours straight with no idea of what is going on. Now I'll go to FCC start my first project. Not worked as much as I intended.

---


### Day 13: February 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the flood fill functionality and it finally worked. Also worked a bit on the Tribute Page (FCC project).

**Thoughts**: Motivation is something very fluctuating. I don't feel unmotivated but I do not feel motivated haha. I don't know if this makes sense. I'm glad I could make the Campo Minado work. On the tribute page was just some tweaks.

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github: https://github.com/kaiorosa1/campo-minado/commit/cef054fcea8efa0350b27b13c6c33e3061187b2d

---


### Day 14: February 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I'm almost done with the Tribute Page. My project passed all the requirements but I still want to be working on it to make it better and prettier. I wrote a readme on GitHub of the Campo Minado, it's a work in progress but it's something. Due to issues with C9 I haven't worked on Campo Minado as much. I implemented a function and changed some bits.

**Thoughts**: It's exciting to work with HTML and CSS because you can see the immediate result and there's something fun in that.

---


### Day 15: February 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked for 30 minutes on my Tribute Page and I was finally happy with the way it looked. It's simple but I liked the end result of it. I also created the restart game functionality on Campo Minado and tested some edge cases so that I can solve them in my next session. 

**Thoughts**: I wanted to spend more time programming but unfortunately I can't but I'm making the most that I able to.

---


### Day 16: February 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I took an HTML Quiz on the W3Schools website to review HTML tags and attributes. I started my second project from Free Code Camp (Survey Form) and I finished the backbone of the project. Next, I'll be working on styling the page. I worked on Campo Minado and finally someone is able to win the game. Also, I created some function that will be implemented in the next sessions.

**Thoughts**: I'll start talking about the Udemy courses that I'm taking here as well. I won't be counting them as 100DaysOfCode time (for now)  but they also are work that I'm doing so I want to be writing about him as well. FCC is a lot of fun and it's exciting to be working on projects even though they are simple but you are really putting into use what you learned.

---


### Day 17: February 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Survey Page (FCC) I'm using this opportunity to use Bootstrap 4 on my project. It's not a requirement but I think it's a great opportunity to play around with it and I think when you use bootstrap is easier to make a beautiful project. For the next session, I'll be doing that. I also worked on Campo Minado. I focused on writing analiseJogo.txt and refined to write a file for each match of the game. 

**Thoughts**: It's fun and I think I'm getting a better idea of how long it takes me to build something. Campo Minado is almost at its finish line and I can't wait to spend all my time in web dev projects. I want to be refining and bettering Campo Minado but I think that for my purpose I'm almost done. My purpose was to redo the project and see how I'd have done differently and I've been doing that.

---


### Day 18: February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Survey Page and I added a background image and rearranged some code and added Bootstrap to my form. I also worked on Campo Minado with not much progress it was generating buggy files and I had no idea how to fix them.

**Thoughts**: It will always take longer when you are learning things. I never say that in here but reading and searching are also very present in my sessions. I've been read the Bootstrap doc page to experiment with things in my survey but some of them did not end up in my final version for the day.

---


### Day 19: February 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Campo Minado and solved the problem with the files and I made a big change on analiseJogo function. I've finished my second project on FCC, the survey form page. 

**Thoughts**: Not feeling good today about my code  and about my progress in general but I know that I must keep going and that's the only way that I can better the way I write code and the way I solve problems I feel that my Campo Minado code needs a lot of refactoring but first I'll focus on functionality and then I see what I can do about changes. I wasn't motivated to code today but I coded for 2 hours straight.

---


### Day 20: February 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on Campo Minado and made some changes the way it was handling the flood fill algorithm. This part is working but it's not the way that I want.  Also, I worked on the third project from FCC (Product Landing Page). I only tackled the requirements but not all of them and then I'll be structuring everything to look nice.

**Thoughts**: It was a very rushed session but it's the max that I can do today. Tomorrow I'll be continuing everything. I can't wait to finish Campo Minado and start working on JS projects.

---


### Day 21: February 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on the nav bar in the Product Landing Page and I worked on Campo Minado freeing memory.

**Thoughts**: Not the most productive day but I did some things that were necessary. 

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github: https://github.com/kaiorosa1/campo-minado/commit/7170362eba63723a297c3263f639edbc52d8c599

---


### Day 22: February 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Campo Minado and I finally can say it's finished I'll be revisiting and refactoring and tweaking but all the functionality is done. I'm so proud of myself for finishing it. I've worked on the Product Landing Page and I decided that it was going to be about Khalid and I added Bootstrap to my project.

**Thoughts**: It's an amazing feeling when you finish something you have been working for so long. I could've finished earlier but with incremental steps, I was able to learn so much and it was not overwhelming. Some days were very frustrating and other rewarding and I've been learning so much about myself through this challenge.

---


### Day 23: February 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I dedicated today to finish the Product Landing Page (FCC). I've read a lot and learned more about CSS Flexbox and I could use in a project and that made that much clear for me. 

**Thoughts**: I've made some mini-deadlines for this week and I'm very happy with the pace that everything is going. I've decided to be putting my FCC projects here on GitHub. I'm not sure if it's a good idea but at least I don't lose my streak lol.

---


### Day 24: February 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Technical Documentation Page for an hour and googled a lot of documentation pages to inspire me.

**Thoughts**: It seems like only focusing on FCC made me lazy but today I had a lot on my plate as well.

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github: https://github.com/kaiorosa1/technical-documentation-page-fcc/commit/f26c89de0be1b13fd5cc53c48a6273c6d2bd42cb

---



### Day 25: February 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Technical Documentation Page for an hour. I finally have an idea of how I want to look like and right now all of the requirements are met so I can focus on styling properly. it's ugly right now being honest.

**Thoughts**: Another day where I couldn't do much but I made a lot of progress I think. I played around a bit with the navbar and with some flexbox properties.

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github: https://github.com/kaiorosa1/technical-documentation-page-fcc/commit/5efb30a92940809be51968035ed14316278e8fef


---


### Day 26: February 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on The Technical Documentation Page primarily on the mobile version of it and I changed the style of the page in general. I spend a lot of time reading documentation and examples of code to do some things I had no idea how to start.I've done an extra session just to finish it up.

**Thoughts**: It's been fun working on these projects but I feel like I should be doing more and that I'm not in the right pace to get where I want to be. I'll be working on the Technical Documentation page more and I'll be finishing today. I hope I'll start the next, and very last one, today.

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github: https://github.com/kaiorosa1/technical-documentation-page-fcc/commit/798452217b5f622d9d17520f8ddfe86b4167ee97

---

### Day 27: February 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Personal Portfolio Webpage on FCC. That's pretty much it. It's been a lot of HTML and CSS so far. and search and reading.

**Thoughts**: This week, in general, has been so full and I didn't have as much time as I wanted. I'll try putting more hours next week.

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github: https://github.com/kaiorosa1/personal-portfolio-webpage-fcc/commit/2419982978bc6487ec3ccf052f1a204330c2cf9d

---


### Day 28: February 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the Portfolio page and all the requirements are met. I'm now working to make it pretty. Added bootstrap to it and I'm having problems with displaying the images properly.

**Thoughts**: I've been learning so much with these projects. I understood Flexbox and media query which were very blurred for me in the beginning and now I finally understand how to use them in projects. The qualities of my projects are not the best. I've talked to a friend about this and he suggested me to look for more HTML and CSS projects to do or just to see the code. I think this is a great idea. I intend to finish it today the last project.

---


### Day 29: February 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on The Personal Portfolio Webpage on FCC and I finally finished. It's very rewarding to finish the first of 6 courses and I can't wait to finish them all.

**Thoughts**: I'm so happy and excited with everything that I have learned so far and it's not only about the content itself but about myself as well. I'm very motivated to finish all the remaining courses.

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github: https://github.com/kaiorosa1/personal-portfolio-webpage-fcc/commit/3322146b9fc971db1a414532f9d5a9f63fc12743


---


### Day 30: February 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on some challenges on FCC. Basic JavaScript, variables, how to assign values and how the operators work and how to handle strings. 

**Thoughts**: It's a new chapter for me right now I'm going back to challenges. It's very exciting to be solving challenges and learning about JS. I'll spend a least 30 minutes today trying to figure out what project I'll be focusing next. I have decided that I'm gonna create a new minesweeper but this time in JS.

---

### Day 31: February 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started with a short session working on a CodeWars problem. I want to take my JS skills to the next level and I think websites like that can help me. Also worked on some FCC challenges. Functions, passing arguments, operators and the last ones were about the if-else statement. Continued learning about HTML Canvas.

**Thoughts**: It's very rewarding and frustrating at the same time-solving problems but it's more rewarding haha

---

### Day 32: February 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've done a CodeWars problem and also went through some FCC challenges. Switch statement, solving simple problems using conditionals and the return keyword. A bit about Objects and their notations. Also played around a bit with the HTML Canvas. (I'm following a youtube tutorial.) 

**Thoughts**: I like how the problems of freecodecamp are set up but at the same time I feel that they are not as much challenging at least until now. I'm not putting much pressure about it because I've been covering things that I'm familiar with so let's see when I start learning about Data visualization or even further down the line in JS.

---


### Day 33: February 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've solved a Codewars problem it was one about receiving two strings and creating a new one with the distinct letters from both strings and it should be sorted. I've done a couple of Basic JavaScript challenges on FCC. I've watched a bit of the HTML Canvas Tutorial.

**Thoughts**: I hope that solving a problem every day it will make me better at solving problems and more confident in my ability to do so. I've spent almost 30 minutes in only one problem on FCC. Things are starting to get more challenging. Also, read carefully your code Kaio. Most of this time I spent looking for a bug and it was right in front of my faceu (yep in Korean, sort of). Regarding the HTML Canvas, I want to do a mini-project just to test my knowledge and also to update the js-journey properly.

### Day 34: March 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've watched a bit of the HTML Canvas Tutorial. I've done some challenges on FCC and finish the section about Basic JavaScript. I have solved two problems in Codewars. One was about making sure boxes was labeled correctly and the other one was to get the middle character or the two middles depending if the number was even or odd.

**Thoughts**: It is a rushed day but I'm learning a lot. Future Kaio, please do all your habits in the morning. You're Welcome!

### Day 35: March 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the tutorial about creating objects in the canvas and animating it. I've learned about ES6 features about let, const and a few arrow functions. First time I got stuck on a challenge on FCC. I'm learning about higher order function as map(), filter(), and reduce(). I spend time with not much success solving a challenge on Codewars as well. 

**Thoughts**: I want to change what I've done with the tutorial. I think I understood the challenge but the thing I'm not sure is key to solving the problem. Maybe I didn't as much as I think.

### Day 36: March 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finally finished the challenge about higher-order functions and it was a very simple solution. And I spent more time doing more challenges which have been more challenging than usual and I like it. I have added interactivity in the project (following the tutorial). I've done a late session and I finished the ES6 section. 

**Thoughts**: I've spent an hour trying to solve a simple problem. They are definitely harder than the previous ones. I've done a late session and I finished the ES6 section and it was harder than I expected and a lot to take in. Later on, I'll watch videos about it as a way to review everything.

### Day 37: March 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've done a couple of challenges and I intend to finish the Regex section today. Worked for hours in FCC Challenges and followed the tutorial about the HTML Canvas. Finished the Regex section.

**Thoughts**: It's a lot but it's doable if you put in the time. I can't wait to start to learn more and challenge myself with the projects ahead. Worked on Canvas and tomorrow I will start creating my mini project. The Regex section was pretty hard and I liked it.

### Day 38: March 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've started and finished the Debugging section on FCC. I've started and done a couple of challenges on the Basic Data Structures section. This section is about Arrays and their functions. I also started the Mini Project JS which is gonna be a person animated in the canvas, for now. 

**Thoughts**: The debugging section was a bit underwhelming for me maybe I had too many expectations about it. I thought we would learn about some fancy feature like GNU in C but it was a bunch of console.log. The section about Basic Data Structures is very interesting because dissects the Array functions.

---


### Day 39: March 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Finished Basic Data Structure. The last challenges were about Objects and some of its functions. I started the Basic Algorithm Scripting and I've done a couple of them. I also worked on the mini-project and created parts of the character that I'll use for the project.

**Thoughts**: The only challenge that was very confusing was one about nesting arrays or nesting objects. The Basic Algorithm Scripting is all about problems that force you to research and come up with a solution in JS. They are simple but they are good to put everything you learned so far into action.

### Day 40: March 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked for 30 minutes on the Mini Project Canvas JS. It was most refactoring and add functions. I also worked on challenges on FCC. the past two days were all about solving these simple problems but some of them I spent hours to solve. I finished the Basic Algorithm Scripting section and I started Object-Oriented Programming section.

**Thoughts**: I started with the Canvas Project because it started raining and I don't want to lose my GitHub streak because of the lack of internet. Luckily, it stopped raining and my 100-day challenge won't be affected. Right now I'm in the last one and it's been very hard. I want to move on so I'll spend as much time as I need to finish this section today. yay, I finished today!!

---


### Day 41: March 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started off with Mini Project and I made the character move a bit. I created a function update that adds 1 to its x coordinates so it seems like it's moving. I've done a couple of OOP challenges. 

**Thoughts**: It's very hard to come up with ideas to the Mini Project Canvas JS. I want to be learning more about the designing process at least to have a rough idea of how what I'm gonna do beforehand.

---


### Day 42: March 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the OOP section which was very interesting on FCC. I've made progress in the Mini project my character is bouncing side to side on the canvas. 

**Thoughts**: OOP section on FCC was quite alright since I already know other programming languages the concept of inheritance was pretty chill and I guess it was more syntax that I had to pay more attention.

### Day 43: March 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've been diving into the Functional Programming section and it's one of the hard ones. FP is all about functions and how your function should not change the original data. There are a lot of concepts like pure functions, first-class objects, first-class functions... I've been understanding it better how map() and filter() works under the hood since they do not change the original data/ function that you pass to it. if they receive functions or return functions they have special names that I don't remember for the life of me. lol. I have finished the Functional Programming section. I also worked on putting my portfolio page live using Github Pages.

**Thoughts**: ES6, Regex and Functional Programming must be the topics that I'll be needing more time coding and reading and etc to really understand well how they work. I've done and been doing challenges and understanding them but I'm not feeling is enough. I must say that this has been my favorite section so far. I've had several of those lightbulb moments because I finally understood how forEach and splice, slice, filter, map, reduce, every, some and so on function work and their return values. I'll definitely go back to this section and review everything. So enlightening!

### Day 44: March 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've done a couple of challenges in the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting section on FCC. This section is hard and I'll be in it for a couple of days I'm sure about that.

**Thoughts**: I've made some changes about what I'll do in this challenges I'll dedicate to solve FCC challenges because classes are back and I won't be having as much time as I want to be working on more than one thing so I decided that it's gonna be freeCodeCamp and then I choose something else. The key is consistency and I've been loving FCC.

### Day 45: March 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've solved one problem on FCC. This section has been very hard and I've been taking a lot of time-solving the challenges.

**Thoughts**: I believe that this section is being very good and I've been learning a lot. The Intermediate Algorithm Scripting section has been very challenging and I'll try to work on one more challenge today. I did but I couldn't finish it

---


### Day 46: March 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I could solve exact two challenges on the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting. I've used Regex on them.

**Thoughts**: It's been fun solving those challenges. I want to spend more time on FCC but I don't know what is going to happen next. Of course, I'll put my hour in but I want to do more. It's necessary.

---


### Day 47: March 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I have solved three challenges today. I've been stepping it up day by day. Today was very regex-y as well and one was about Fibonacci. I didn't like my solution for the last problem but it worked I can go back later on and I'll probably come up with a better solution.

**Thoughts**: I've been incorporating a lot what I've been learning in the problem I can confidently say that I'm feeling more and more comfortable with JS. I can't wait to learn more and become an expert in it, lol. I know I'm ambitious. I'm working to get there.

### Day 48: March 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've solved two challenges on FCC. I'll probably work in this section for a week or so. 

**Thoughts**: The challenges itself were not as hard but I've putting exact one hour a day so I'm doing the best that I can.

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github: https://github.com/kaiorosa1/js-journey/commit/2e08ec3b25e00b55643b668e3a948601ef6187fe

### Day 49: March 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've solved two challenges on FCC. The first one I used a closure to solve it and the second one was about decoding a sequence of characters.

**Thoughts**: Today it feels like I will never finish all those challenges there are so many left. I'll try solving more tomorrow. Consistency is key!!

### Day 50: March 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I have solved one challenge today and it's been very a rewarding one. I've been trying to solve it since a couple days ago. It was one about comparing objects and filtering out some of them. Seems simple to understand the problem but the actual coding took me a long time, not to write it but to come up with the solution. In another session I've solved another one. It is rewarding when they are hard and you are able to solve them.

**Thoughts**: I can't wait to finish them all. I want to be working on projects and building stuff that feels more like programming something tangible rather than some school challenges.

### Day 51: March 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've solved one challenge and it was an easy one. I tried solving another one more difficult but it seemed that I  wasn't going nowhere so I switched it up. 

**Thoughts**: I takes me more time than I expect. I want to say how the next days are gonna look like because it seems like it's been harder and harder to solve one. I'm not saying that the challenges are getting harder but it seems like I could spent hours and hours without ever finishing one and right now I have limited time.

### Day 52: March 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've solved one challenge and to be honest I'm surprised. I've tried solving another one but it seems like my code is not very efficient. In the future I want to be able to take a hard class on OOP to be able to  understand better my code and also to start writing more elegant code.

**Thoughts**: This is not the first time this happens. I want to come up with a better thought out solution but I also would like to be able to submit the less glamurous version right now. I think this probably means my solution is terrible. I will come up with a better one I know. Btw the one I solved though it was a solution.

### Day 53: March 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I have solved one more challenge on FCC. The Intermediate Algorithm Scripting is a very hard section. I didn't expect to be this hard. Most of the section I've completed in about two hours but this one is taking me so long.

**Thoughts**: I'm gaining back my confidence in solving problems. Don't get me wrong I love challenges and the feeling you get once you finally figure out what's being keeping you from finishing but I also like the feeling of progress and I've been feeling stuck and these past days made me realize that I need to focus on JS to really master all the concepts.

### Day 54: March 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've solved one more challenge. This last challenge I solved was about summing all prime numbers up to a given number and I could've solved this way from the beginning but I wanted to find another easier way. Turned out that was the easy way to solve it. 

**Thoughts**: If you have an idea of how to solve the problem go for it, even if seems complicated or not optimal.

### Day 55: March 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have finished the Intermediate Algorithm Scripiting section. I had three remaining challenges and I decided that I was going to finish them all. I have to celebrate because it was very hard to get here. I hope I got better in the process. Later on, I've finished the first project.

**Thoughts**: Feeling good because I finish all of the Intermediate Algoritm Scripting section but at the same time a bit disappointed because it took me so long. Like I've mentioned I'll be spending more time with JS I need to better my skills so badly.

---

### Day 56: March 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've solved the second project which was Ceasars Cipher on FCC. The section says projects but this time the projects are harder exercises. I liked this idea since we are still learning the concepts in JS.

**Thoughts**: I've been finding solving the projects easier than some Intermediate Algorith Scripting section but maybe it's because I have some blind spot in some concepts. I don't know I just glad I'm done with them for now.

### Day 57: March 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've solved the project about validating a phone number. I can see in this entire certification is the value of understand Regex fully. We have a lot of challeges along the way that it's easier to solve if you know your Regexes haha. 

**Thoughts**: I've been learning so much and I'm feeling more and more confident about writing code in JS. I'll get back to learning Js on Udemy. I still have so much to learn it's exciting.

### Day 58: March 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finish the project about converting a decimal to the roman equivalent. It wasn't very hard but my solution was not the best one but it worked.

**Thoughts**: It's gonna be a very hard week because I need to study for an upcoming exam. I'm glad I could finish another project and hopefully tomorrow I'll be finish the certification. The plans are very fuzzy and I hope I can clear things out when I get home today.

### Day 59: March 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked for almost an hour and a half and now I understand how people are not consistent with habits. I didn't finish any challenge and this is the last one I need to work on before getting my certification.

**Thoughts**: I've made a change on my portifolio page but this does not really count. I'll be working on the challenge until 23h but I doubt I finish it today. It's not because it's hard but it's long to code or at least my solution is.

### Day 60: March 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have finished the last project on the JS certification. I'm so happy I finally finished my second certification. Now I have the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification. I still have 4 certification to go!

**Thoughts**: It was harder than I expected but it was the most rewarding was well. I loved working through the problems I still have a long journey and I feel I'm a better developer already I can't wait to be great at it and working on interesting projects.

### Day 61: March 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on some BootStrap challenges. I'm very excited to learn about Front-End Libraries. I've solved one problem in the last FCC section.

**Thoughts**: I'm most looking forward to start learning React but for the moment is nice to revisit some BootStrap functionalities. I've solved the challenge just because I wanted to have something to make a commit. I'll use the weekend to switch gears and thing about how I'm going to be commiting. I want to start use a session to learn more JS I don't feel I'm done yet to move on to something else. I'll probably solve another challenge like that tomorrow as well.

### Day 62: March 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've solved some Bootstrap challenges and worked on Project Euler (FCC) on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: I've been loving documenting my journey in this quick way. This weekend I start planning what the nexts weeks are going to look like, there's lot of JS in the way that is for sure.

### Day 63: March 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the Bootstrap section on the Front-End Libraries Certification on FCC. I also solved a Project Euler challenge.  

**Thoughts**: It's been pretty chill and I already had an idea of how to use Bootstrap so it was more a review of the features. I know Bootstrap is pretty powerful. It's funny how quickly you can solve a challenge and how hard and impossible seems to solve another.

### Day 64: March 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've solved some JQuery challenges on FCC. I'm dividing 30 minutes to the Front End Libraries Certification and 30 minutes to solving JS problems. I've worked on changing my portfolio page.

**Thoughts**: JQuery are not that interesting since I know that it's not that useful anymore. But it's always fun to learn about it.

### Day 65: April 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a friend's portfolio. I've finished the JQuery section on FCC.

**Thoughts**: I believe working on this project is going to be very interesting since it's a beautiful website that I have to start from scratch. The next section is about Sass I don't know what it is but I'm very interested in learning more about it. I think it's related to CSS but I don't know how it is.

---

### Day 66: April 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the Sass section on FCC. Worked on Rodrigo's portfolio.

**Thoughts**: Sass is a CSS extension and enables you to use logic whithin you CSS code so it is very useful I can't wait to strenghten my learning by using in the projects.

### Day 67: April 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on Rodrigo's portfolio and create and started working on the motion_graphics.html. Worked on some React challenges on FCC.

**Thoughts**: Working on a time crunch is always fun.(-.-) I will spend more 30 minutes on FCC.

---

### Day 68: April 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Rodrigo's portfolio and created a grid for the motion_graphics.html. I'm taking my time to build this portfolio to learn and get comfortable with CSS grid and flexbox and other technologies I'll be using throughout this project. I worked on some React challenges on FCC. 

**Thoughts**: It's fun to work on a project the process would be speed up if I was able to spend more time in it. I want that for the next projects it takes me fraction of the time I'm taken right now.

### Day 69: April 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on Rodrigo's portfolio and I've created all the files I'll be working on and also made some changes the motion_graphics.html. I've solved some React Challenges on FCC. 

**Thoughts**: Having a desing plan would me help me so much but for now I don't have this vison yet but in the next projects I hope I can be more organized doing that. The React challenges on FCC are both boring and hard at the same time maybe that sould make it interesting but they do not. Not shitting on them I love freeCodeCamp but this certification so far is not as fun as the last one.

### Day 70: April 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on the contato.html on Rodrigo's portfolio. I worked on some React challenges on FCC.

**Thoughts**: Working on this project gives me security to be working on more challenging projects in the future.

### Day 71: April 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've started my first React App and I've done some React challenges on FCC. I also add font-awesome and stylized the icons on Rodrigo's portfolio.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling I'm getting the hang of how React works and how I'll be using it in future projects. Creating components makes it very organized I need to learn more about state but it's very exciting to be learning my first Front-End Library.

### Day 72: April 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on teh logos and position them right on Rodrigo's portfolio. I've solved a couple of React challenges on FCC. I've learned about state and how it is important to be encapsulated and how to define default values and requirements for the properties you create in your components.

**Thoughts**: It's very fun to be working on something that you can immediately see the progress. I've putting little effort but I can already see the results. I feel very excited to be doing something for someone else.

### Day 73: April 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on Rodrigo's portfolio, right now I've been focusing on the looks of each page. I created the instagram grid that I intend to use the instagram API to fetch from if this is a thing haha I don't know much about API and this is gonna be a very good experience working with that. Also worked on React challenges on FCC.

**Thoughts**: I'm very excited to be halfway in the portfolio I'm creating from scratch. The design was made by my friend Rodrigo but I'm creating each component and adjusting and everything.

### Day 74: April 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on some React challenges on FCC. And also  started working on another page for Rodrigo's portfolio. I hope to be finish with this project by the end of next week.

**Thoughts**: Very convoluted day but I'm able to keep up the pace. Tomorrow I have a exam in college and I need to focus the rest of the day studying more.

### Day 75: April 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked more on Rodrigo's portfolio. Worked on some React challenges on FCC. I've leared about how to pass function as props and how can we update properties in the state. 

**Thoughts**: There are some days that we put off the work as much as we can. Today was one of them. I can understand the concept of state but at the same time I feel it's very confusing at times.

### Day 76: April 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on some React challenges on FCC. I've learned about lifecycles and how to use css inline styles within React. Worked on Rodrigo's portfolio. 

**Thoughts**: Today's challenges were pretty chill. I'm realising that I can go through them faster but I like the pace that I'm going. It's funny that with experience you start to get this intuition and know where to look to find what you want. Today was my first experience with that with CSS.

### Day 77: April 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked a bit more my React App and I've done some React Challenges. I've done some React challenges on FCC. 

**Thoughts**: It's been a long day I haven't finsihed neither the React App nor the React challenges.

### Day 78: April 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I finally finished the React section on FCC. I've learned about how to use Array.map() and Array.filter() in that context. Being honest doesn't seem different than using in JS. I've worked on realidade.css and thing are starting to get shape.

**Thoughts**: What I like about Free Code Camp is that it's a great tool if you are trying to know what to learn next. Even though I feel that they don't explain some fundamental like, recursion and inheritance and some other things that are very much a must when learning a framework like React, it can be a great way to gain a basic knowledge and go find more in-depth content elsewhere.
I feel I need to learn more about JS and React but I feel comfortable enough to read the documentantion and start playing around with it. We have a lot of great free content out there and I will be using those to better my skills. I feel a bit frustated thinking that it's been taking me so long to do this project. I feel like I should be doing it in less time.

### Day 79: April 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've solved some Redux challenges on FCC. I've worked on Rodrigo's portfolio. I've changed the UI a bit and I basically changed most of the files. I believe it's gonna be easier now to finish what I need.

**Thoughts**:  I understand how to solve the challenges but I think they are all over the place. For example what Redux adds to our learning. What can we do with React? Is React a model of how things should be put on our front-end development. Being honest I find all of these very hard to grasp. I understand that when we are dealing with big projects we cannot rely on only CSS and HTML we need something more effective and more robust but what frameworks do for us. I can't understand that yet at the time of writing this.

### Day 80: April 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've learned more about Redux solving the FCC challenges. I've worked on the instagram logo in the page. I've learned of how to overlay divs. The portfolio is almost looking the way that I want to (aka the actual final look).

**Thoughts**: I feel that I still don't understand when we need to use Redux but I know when I finish all the challenges in the Front-end libraries certification I want to be focusing on React/Redux and JS. I have bought a few JS courses that I'll be diving in once I'm finsihed with the challenges. I probably learn more before going into the projects. Like I said before I'm really glad stuff like FCC exists and it's free and all but they lack in some fundamental aspects and I know I need to complement them with other courses and reading documentation. What is awesome about freeCodeCamp is the mentality that puts you in. I'll finish all of the certifications and I intend to make videos about my experience with each certification. Who  know what the future holds.

### Day 81: April 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on Rodrigo's portofolio and solved some Redux challenges on FCC.

**Thoughts**: It was a very hectic day and I had so much on my plate. I'm glad I could work at least a bit on the challenge

### Day 82: April 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've finsihed (sort of) the motion graphics page from my friend's portfolio. I've finished the Redux challenges on FCC. 

**Thoughts**: I procrastinated so much today but at least I've been consistent with the hours I put in. Of course there are plenty of room for improvement and I'll do better next time (They always say that but I mean it). Not feeling as confident about Redux. Also I want to buy Colt Steele new course on React so bad. I know his methodology and I know most of the problems I'm having now about understand will go away.

### Day 83: April 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've focused on reviewing React and Redux. I used thenewboston tutorial to speed up the process. I think the only thing I hadn't heard before was about refs but the rest was pretty much a revision of everything I have seen on freeCodeCamp. I've changed a bit Rodrigo's portfolio, I think I'll be able to be done with it this weekend. I have a lot of features to work on. I need to learn how to connect with an API and stuff. I started the React and Redux section on FCC.

**Thoughts**: Reviewing has been a good way to check that I've been learning everything. There is so much to learn and I've been exposed to so many thing that is easy to think that you didn't retain as much but I'm glad that I'm retaining and understanding more than I expected. The progress part and the thoughts part sometimes interchange lol. I've been learning so much doing Rodrigo's portfolio.

### Day 84: April 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I started working on the details of the Portfolio page. The next step is figure out how to add the functionalites. I have to work on the transitions of the page. I've worked on some React and Redux challenges on FCC.

**Thoughts**: I've been getting more and more comfortable with HTML and CSS and it's funny that this used to be very hard to think or to know where to look. I've talked about that before. These challenges are very hard I don't remember the stuff I need to use or they are written in away that is very confusing.

### Day 85: April 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've solved a couple of React and Redux challenges on FCC. I think I'm starting to get the hang of it. I've added details to realidade_aumentada.html

**Thoughts**: It's not as intuitive as the challenges might seem, sometimes I do know what to do but I get stuck because I put a div enclosing the provider. I don't know if this would make a difference in my code but for the FCC tests it does and I'm spending a lot of time looking for an error. I understand that this process will help me debug my code better but it's a bit frustanting.

### Day 86: April 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on another page on Rodrigo's porfolio. I've worked on React and Redux challenges on FCC.

**Thoughts**: I'm finishing up some of the details I think I'll show him and I start working on the functionality. I believe I'll be using APIs and stuff that I have to figure out in the process.

### Day 87: April 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on some details on Rodigo's portfolio. I've worked on some React and Redux challenges on FCC.

**Thoughts**: It's a very busy day and I spent most of it studying for a exam I have on Thursday. I;ve been putting my hour in. Not being pessimist about my time but I think I'm not gonna be putting more than one hour this week.

### Day 88: April 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've finished the React and Redux section on FCC. I've changed a bit index.html on Rodrigo's portfolio. 

**Thoughts**: I've finsihed all the section on the Front-End Libraries Certification and I need to say that was underwhelming. I'm very exicted to be working on projects but I'm not satisfied with this last section. I feel that was a bit rushed and not very well explained but at the same time I feel that maybe I'm being too harsh. I love freeCodeCamp but I can see that there are some sections that are not well thought out. I have the impression that most people give up on FCC after the JavaScript certification so they don't have as much support.

### Day 89: April 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've finished the index.html for now and I'm diving into learning how to make a cool transition between pages.

**Thoughts**: Knowing how to search is an essential skill. I'll be going back to FCC on this weekend. I want to prioritize finsihing a project.

### Day 90: April 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on some details on Rodrigo's portfolio. 

**Thoughts**: It's been a very slow day for no reason. Page transitions still something I need to master before putting into my project.

### Day 91: April 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I started working on the page transitions I've found a jQuery plugin called Animsition I hope it can help me.

**Thoughts**: I'm getting the feeling that if I had made the project with React I'd have been having a better time with page transitions. I've seen something about React router or something and I think it's useful, maybe I'm just throwing random nonsense.

### Day 92: April 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  It finally worked the transition and I'm working on making it work with the current project. I was a bit worried that the plugin wouldn't be a good fit but fortunately it was.

**Thoughts**: I've spent an hour figuring out how to make it work and tweaking it to the protfolio. I'm not done yet but I'll be soon enough. I'm afraid the trickiest part is yet to come. I've googled a bit and the instragram API is being discontinued and my inital thought was to make an API call to use Rodrigo's most recent photos to show up in the instagram grid in the project. I don't know what I am gonna do but I'll come up with something once I start working on that.

### Day 93: April 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I thought it was time to get back to my own portfolio and add some things. I added an About Me section and added the portuguese version of the website.

**Thoughts**: I want to be finished with all these portfolio stuff and start working on some more backend-y stuff (if I am making any sense). Where to go? What projects to work on? And how can I better myself to be a more competitive candidate when I go to interviews? Are questios that have been on my mind lately. I want to be working on everything but I know I have limited time. That is why I think I need to continue on a second round on the 100DaysOfCode but right now I think a second round might be too much I need to make this decision soon. Maybe I should take a break or maybe this will slow myself in backing to it. I don't know so many questions that I don't have the answer now.

### Day 94: April 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on Rodrigo's portfolio. I added the animation to the remaining pages. I added an event listener to handle when the right and left arrow key is pressed. 

**Thoughts**: It's very fun to be working on front-end stuff but I feel that I need to start learning about backend stuff I feel that that's what I will shine more. It's fun to use JS to solve a problem. I'm always excited when I use JavaScript for something.

### Day 95: May 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on the sliding effect on Rodrigo's portfolio. I verified the current page and then I then when the right or left arrow is pressed they go to a page accordingly.

**Thoughts**:  I love the feeling of accomplishment when you solve something. I'm feeling I have a better understanding of how to create web application.

### Day 96: May 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Today was most fixing the bugs when I was transitioning through the pages with the arrows in the keyboard. I'm following a React tutorial and I've watched a few of them. 

**Thoughts**: For some reason two pages were not working when I pressed the keys to go to another page but I fixed with some ease. It's funny because when I watch React Tutorial I'm feeling that I understand but I don't feel confident enough to start the FCC projects. I need to plan better because I feel that I can do much better than I'm doing I've spent about 20 days in a project that I know now that I could've spent less time. I know that I have been only spend half an hour per day but still. I hope in the next 100 days of code round I can be more mindful of the time I spend and better at planning.

### Day 97: May 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have added the spanish version of my portfolio page. I don't have a button to switch it to spanish but it's almost functional. I've reviewed more React.

**Thoughts**: One of those days that I didn't have as much time as I wanted to work on my projects. I've split it into two sessions. The past days I've learning and reviewing React and I must say Academind is the best one yet. Very clear and very thorough. I've watched the React basics series on thenewboston and it can't compare. I don't know if it's because it's the second time reviewing but I really like Maximilian's teaching style.

### Day 98: May 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have worked on my portfolio and even wrote in the about me section. I've watched some React Tutorials.

**Thoughts**: I'm alsomst at the end of the challenge and I feel I haven't done enough. I'm sure I want to continue but I'm not sure if it's the right decision. I always feel it's not the right time but it's never the right time. Life will always get in the way so I feel that if I really want to do I have to be able to make it work. But I know that burning myself out is never the way.

### Day 99: May 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've changed my portfolio. I've watched a tutorial on Express. I'm not deviating from learning React I was very curious about creating a Node App. I also watched some React tutorials.

**Thoughts**: I'll be followeing my JS course and also start getting serious about React. I don't feel good just being watching tutorials but I understand they are a great source to learn and also to be inspired.

### Day 100: May 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've made the first refactoring on Rodrigo's portfolio code. I've watched some React tutorials.

**Thoughts**: I can't believe it's been that long since I started it. I'm happy that I was able to code for 100 days straight. I still have a lot to learn and I feel that working one hour a day is not that much time. I'm not surprise I was able to do it but even so it feels great. I have a log of everything I did. (sort of) I haven't decided yet if I will continue right after this 100 days or I will take a short break. This week is gonna be one of a kind. I have loads of assignments and exams due and it's already been stressful. That's college life. right? I learned so much more about me than about code! I won't lie some days I had problem with procrastination and lack of motivation but that didn't stop me from putting my hour in. Most of the days I worked more than an hour. It is a very good opportunity to start working on that project that you've been putting off and to learn that language/framework that you've been wanting for so long. Happy Round 1 for Me!!
