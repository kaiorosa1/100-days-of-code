# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on HTML and CSS on FreeCodeCamp. Finished the HTML Section and did some subsection on the Intro to CSS module. I learned about string function on MySQL and review DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts**: This is a refresher for me at least for now. I decided that I''ll be following FreeCodeCamp's route. Technically it's been weeks that I started coding every day but I start counting for today. I'm studying JavaScript on Udemy and a bit of MySQL. I'm very excited with this challenge and I hope to see great progress in my web dev/coding in general skills.

### Day 2: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I progressed with freeCodeCamp. I finished the section about the CSS basics. I reviewed about margin, padding, hexadecimal and rgb system and CSS variables and importance of fallbacks when it comes to CSS styling. Started working on a minesweeper in C. I only started reading the files to generate the table.

**Thoughts**: It was a bit overwhelming to finish all the module even though it was almost like a review session. I'll try to put my study session as early as possible. Since I'm on vacation I'll be continuing coding but it was not going to be as structure as I intend with this callenge. I want to be working on projects I'm starting that today. It's only simple to-do list in JS. My intention with this challenge is advance as far as I can,resonably, in freeCodeCamp.

### Day 3: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued reading the file tabuleiro.txt from Campo Minado (minesweeper).I did a couple of challenges from  the Applied Visual Design on FCC (FreeCodeCamp).

**Thoughts**: I started differently since I only had 30 minutes to work on something I decided to go with the project I began yesterday. It's a minesweeper but a simplified version. My intention with this project is to finish it according to a specification (I'll propably talk more about that later on). in the 30 minutes left, I worked on some FCC challenges. I did a couple of the Applied Visual Design one and took some notes as I'm usually doing. I intend to separate a day only for review everything I've been learning.

First commit I made today : https://github.com/kaiorosa1/campo-minado/commit/dd680d025ab3b5b5bec7fe3bc21dec39ec5a31ff


### Day 4: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I used one hour to go through Free Code Camp. I stopped at : Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element (Applied Visual Design). I worked on Campo Minado for 30 minutes mainly focusing on designing the data structure I'm going to be using.

**Thoughts**: The challenges are more fun and I'm confident that my CSS skills are getting better. Right now I'm not couting watching Udemy tutorial as work towards the challenge but I eventually will since I don't just watch tutorial, I code along and take notes and try to do myself as much as I can and most tutorial that I watch have follow up exercises which I do as well.

### Day 5: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on some Free Code Camp challenges for an hour. I stopped at : Applied Visual Design: Animate Elements at Variable Rates (Applied Visual Design). Coded more on Campo Minado.

**Thoughts**: It's been a crazy day. I don't know why but I don't seem to get focused.Fortunately I worked an hour on free code camp. The first time on my project that I have to think twice about what I'm doing. that's what coding is about.

### Day 6: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on the design aspect of the Campo Minado, meaning in what type of fuctions and the paramenters and testing the functions I created so far. I've spent an hour creating functions like print and allocation memory and making sure it's working the way I intentionally designed them. Also finsihed the section about applied visual and design and worked on some sections on the next section. I stopped at : Applied Accessibility: Improve Chart Accessibility with the figure Element (Applied Accessibility).

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I started this challenge I'm feeling very productive and I'm learning a lot by coding my project and using FCC. I'm not finding FCC as challenging yet but I'm sure when the projects come along and I go further down the line I'll have my fair share of wondering why I choose programming in the first place. Just kidding! Am I?

### Day 7: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent 30 minutes on Campo Minado and changed a bit some functions.  I worked around 40 minutes on FCC and finished the Applied Accessibility module. I stopped at : Responsive Web Design Principles: Create a Media Query (Responsive Web Design Principles).

**Thoughts**: I felt the my first session was not very productive and I didn't go as far as I wanted. It's a bit buggy my code my that's what happens when you are programming, not all your code is good from the get go. I'm feeling that I'm not making a lot of progress on FCC as I thought I would but it's because I make sure I read everything and take notes carefully before moving on to the next challenge or maybe I'm slow (no worries) lol.

### Day 8: February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started and finsihed the Responsive Web Design Principles.  I stopped at: CSS Flexbox: Use display: flex to Position Two Boxes (CSS Flexbox). I worked on Campo Minado with not much progress. I try to change how I was reading from the file. I decided to copy the file first and then I was going to change the 1s and 0s to the bombs and empty places.

**Thoughts**: I'm very excited that I'm two section to go to start working on project to apply everything I've learned so far. I'm also very excited to start working with CSS flexbox. I know I'm taking small steps towards finishing FCC but I think in this way I won't burn out quickly and I plan to start working more hours weeks from now. I hit a road block with Campo Minado and I have no idea how to solve the problem that I have so I'll use the rest of the time I planned searching and tweaking and coding. Good Luck to me!

### Day 9: February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Campo Minado and I implemented a bunch of function. It's printing the table completely and I calculated the neighbors bombs and everything. Worked as well on FCC problems for 30 minutes or so and I got back to Campo Minado and worked some more on implementing realizarJogada().

**Thoughts**: Through lots of researching and testing I found the bug and it was with allocating memory. It's always related to that when we are dealing with C. Feeling good about the progress I made and I worked for 2 hours + straight until I saw my progress flowing. Flexbox is very interesting and useful, I'm only at the beginning but I already like it.

### Day 10: February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished CSS Flexbox on FCC. It's much like reading documentation. Mainly worked on the final design of the final table of Campo Minado.

**Thoughts**: I feel that I'll learn more when I get to the projects. The challenges are fun but it's more like testing and reading documentation. I don't force myself to remember all those properties, I do take notes but I don't think I'll be able to remember everything I learned so far if I don't use it constanstly.

### Day 11: February 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've fishished the FCC section about CSS grid. It was fun and there are a phonebook of properties like the the other CSS sections. CSS grid is a easier way to format your elements and a very useful tool to have when dealing with responsiveness. I worked on the flood fill functionality of the minesweeper on Campo Minado. 

**Thoughts**: It was fun to learn this last section and now I get to work on 5 projects and I'll start them tomorrow or maybe later today. Following my schedule I'll work on Campo minado for a bit. I think I close to finishing Campo Minado. The flood fill function is not working a hundred percent but I'm confident enough that I can solve that by tomorrow.

### Day 12: February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the flood fill functionality of the Campo Minado with not much success. I worked on FCC Tribute Page. Mainly was creating the structure like divs and setting ids and changing colors of elements.

**Thoughts**: It's normal to  get stuck I know but it sucks every time it happens. I'm struggling to understand what is wrong with my code. I know where the bug is but I don't know how to fix it yet. Later today I'll go back to it. I'm realising that giving you this time constraint instead of a task one. It's been very refreshing and less frustating than working for 4 hours straight with no idea of what is going on. Now I'll go to FCC start my first project. Not worked as much as I inteded.

### Day 13: February 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the floodfill functionality and it finally worked. Also worked a bit on the Tribute Page (FCC project).

**Thoughts**: Motivation is something very fluctuating. I don't feel unmotivated but I do not feel motivated haha. I don't know if this makes sense. I'm glad I could make the Campo Minado work. On the tribute page was just some tweaks.

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github :https://github.com/kaiorosa1/campo-minado/commit/cef054fcea8efa0350b27b13c6c33e3061187b2d


### Day 14: February 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I'm almost done with the Tribute Page. My project passed all the requirements but I still want to be working on  it to make it better and prettier. I wrote a readme on GitHub of the Campo Minado, it's a work in progress but it's something. Due to issues with C9 I haven't worked on Campo Minado as much. I implemented a function and changed some bits.

**Thoughts**: It's exciting to work with HTML and CSS because you can see the immediate result and there's something fun in that.

### Day 15: February 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked for 30 minutes on my Tribute Page and I was finally happy with the way it looked. It's simple but I liked the end result of it. I also created the restart game funcionality on Campo Minado and tested some edge cases so that I can solve them in my next session. 

**Thoughts**: I wanted to spend more time programing but unfortunately I can't but I'm making the most that I able to.

### Day 16: February 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I took a HTML Quiz on W3Schools website to review HTML tags and attributes. I started my second project from Free Code Camp (Survey Form) and I finished the backbone of the project. Next I'll be working on styling the page. I worked on Campo Minado and finally someone is able to win the game. Also, I created some function that will be implemented in the next sessions.

**Thoughts**: I'll start talking about the Udemy courses that I'm taking here as well. I won't be counting them as 100DaysOfCode time (for now)  but they are also work that I'm doing so I want to be writing about him as well. FCC is a lot of fun and it's exciting to be working on projects even though they are simple but you are really putting into use what you learned.

### Day 17: February 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Survey Page (FCC) I'm using this opportunity to use Bootstrap 4 on my project. It's not a requirement but I think it's a great opporutunity to play around with it and I think when you use bootstrap is easier to make a beautiful project. For the next session I'll be doing that. I also worked on Campo Minado. I focused on writing analiseJogo.txt and refined to write a file for each match of the game. 

**Thoughts**: It's fun and I think I'm getting a better idea of how long it takes me to build something. Campo Minado is almost at its finsih line and I can't wait to spend all my time in web dev projects. I want to be refining and bettering Campo Minado but I think that for my purpose I'm almost done. My purpose was to redo the project and see how I'd have done differently and I've been doing that.

### Day 18: February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Survey Page and I addeda a background image and rearrenged some code and added Bootstrap to my form. I also worked on Campo Minado with not much progress it was generating buggy files and I had not idea how to fix them.

**Thoughts**: It will always take longer when you are learning things. I never say that in here but reading and searching are also very present in my sessions. I've been read the Bootstrap doc page to experiment with things in my survey but some of them did not end up in my final version for the day.

### Day 19: February 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Campo Minado and solved the problem with the files and I made a big change on analiseJogo function. I've finished my second project on FCC, the survey form page. 

**Thoughts**: Not feeling good today about my code  and about my progress in general but I know that I must keep going and that's the only way that I can better the way I write code and the way I solve problems I feel that my Campo Minado code needs a lot of refactoring but first I'll focus on functionality and then I see what I can do about changes. I wasn't motivated to code today but I coded for 2 hors straight.

### Day 20: February 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on Campo Minado and made some changes the way it was handling the floodfill algorithm. This part is working but it's not the way that I want.  Also, I worked on the third project from FCC (Product Landing Page). I only tackled the requirements but not all of them and then I'll be structuring everything to look nice.

**Thoughts**: It was a very rushed session but it's the max the I can do today. Tomorrow I'll be continuing everything. I can't wait to finish Campo Minado and start working on JS projects.

### Day 21: February 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on the nav bar in the Product Landing Page and I worked on Campo Minado freeing memory.

**Thoughts**: Not the most productive day but I did some things that was necessary. 

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github : https://github.com/kaiorosa1/campo-minado/commit/7170362eba63723a297c3263f639edbc52d8c599


### Day 22: February 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Campo Minado and I finally can say it's finished I'll be revisiting and refactoring and tweaking but all the functionality is done. I'm so proud of myself for finishing it. I've worked on the Product Landing Page and I decided that it was going to be about Khalid and I added Bootstrap to my project.

**Thoughts**: It's an amazing feeling when you finsish something you have been working for so long. I could've finished earlier but with incremental steps I was able to learn so much and it was not overwhelming. Some days were very frustating and other rewarding and I've been learning so much about myself through this challenge.

### Day 23: February 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I dedicated today to finish the Product Landing Page (FCC). I've read a lot and learned more about CSS Flexbox and I could use in a project and that made that much clear for me. 

**Thoughts**: I've made some mini deadlines for this week and I'm very happy with the pace that everything is going. I've decided to be putting my FCC projects here on GitHub. I'm not sure if it's good idea but at least I don't lose my streak lol.

### Day 24: February 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Technical Documentation Page  for an hour and googled a lot of documentation pages to inspire me.

**Thoughts**: It seems like only focusing on FCC made me lazy but today I had a lot on my plate as well.

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github : https://github.com/kaiorosa1/technical-documentation-page-fcc/commit/f26c89de0be1b13fd5cc53c48a6273c6d2bd42cb



### Day 25: February 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Technical Documentation Page  for an hour. I finally have an idea of how I want to look like and right now all of the requirements are met so I can focus on styling properly. it's ugly right now being honest.

**Thoughts**: Another day where I couldn't do much but I made a lot of progress I think. I played around a bit with the navbar and with some flexbox properties.

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github : https://github.com/kaiorosa1/technical-documentation-page-fcc/commit/5efb30a92940809be51968035ed14316278e8fef



### Day 26: February 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on The Technical Documentation Page primarily on the mobile version of it and I changed the style of the page in general. I spend a lot of time reading documentation and examples of code to do some things I had no idea how to start.I've done and extra session just to finish it up.

**Thoughts**: It's been fun working on theses projects but I feel like I should be doing more and that I'm not in the right pace to get where I want to be. I'll be working on the Technical Documentation page more and I'll be finishing today. I hopefully I'll start the next, and very last one, today.

### Day 27: February 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Personal Portifolio Webpage on FCC. That's pretty much it. It's been a lot of HTML and CSS so far. and search and reading.

**Thoughts**: This week in general has been so full and I didn't have as much time as I wanted. I'll try putting more hours next week.

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github : https://github.com/kaiorosa1/personal-portfolio-webpage-fcc/commit/2419982978bc6487ec3ccf052f1a204330c2cf9d


### Day 28: February 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the Portifolio page and all the requirements are met. I'm now working to make it pretty. Added bootstrap to it and I'm having problems with displaying the images properly.

**Thoughts**: I've been learning so much with this projects. I understood Flexbox and media query which were very blurred for me in the beginning and now I finally understand how to use them in projects. The qualities of my projects are not the best. I've talked to a friend about this and he suggested me to look for more HTML and CSS projects to do or just to see the code. I think this is a great idea. I intend to finish it today the last project.

### Day 29: February 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on The Personal Portifolio Webpage on FCC and I finally finished. It's very rewarding to finish the first of 6 courses and I can't wait to finish them all.

**Thoughts**: I'm so happy and excited with everything that I have learned so far and it's not only about the content itself but about myself as well. I'm very motivated to finish all the remaining courses.

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github : https://github.com/kaiorosa1/personal-portfolio-webpage-fcc/commit/3322146b9fc971db1a414532f9d5a9f63fc12743



### Day 30: February 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on some challenges on FCC. Basic JavaScript, variables, how to assign values and how the operators work and how to handle strings. 

**Thoughts**: It's a new chapter for me right now I'm going back to challenges. It's very exciting to be solving challenges and learning about JS. I'll spend a least 30 minutes today trying to figure out what project I'll be focusing next. I have decided that I'm gonna create a new minesweeper but this time in JS.

### Day 31: February 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started with a short session working on a CodeWars problem. I want to take my JS skills to the next level and I think websites like that can help me. Also worked on some FCC challenges. Functions, passing arguments, operators and the last ones were about if-else statement. Continued learning about HTML Canvas.

**Thoughts**: It's very rewarding and frustating at the same time solving problems but it's more rewarding haha

**Link(s) to work**: Commit on Github : https://github.com/kaiorosa1/js-journey/commit/8765fd640b7fd87bbe2678e2795c091c5a471ea7



### Day 32: February 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've done a CodeWars problem and also went through some FCC challenges. Switch statement, solving simple problems usings conditionals and the return keyword. A bit about Objects and its notations. Also played around a bit with the HTML Canvas. (I'm following a youtube tutorial.) 

**Thoughts**: I like how the problems of freecodecamp are set up but at the same time I feel that they are not as much challenging at least until now. I'm not putting much pressure about it because I've been covering things that I'm familiar with so let's see when I start learning about Data visualization or even further down the line in JS.

### Day 33: February 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've solved a Codewars problem it was one about receiving two strings and creating a new one with the distict letters from both strings and it should be sorted. I've done a couple Basic JavaScript challenges on FCC. I've watched a bit of the HTML Canvas Tutorial.

**Thoughts**: I hope that solving a problem everyday it will make me better at solving problems and more confident in my hability of doing so. I've spent almost 30 minutes in only one problem on FCC. Things are starting to get more challenging. Also read carefully your code Kaio. Most of this time I spent looking for a bug and it was right in front of my faceu (yep in korean , sort of). Regarding the HTML Canvas I want to do a mini-project just to test my knowledge and also to update the js-journey properly.

### Day 34: February 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've watched a bit of the HTML Canvas Tutorial. I've done some challenges on FCC and finish the section about Basic JavaScript. I have solved two problems in Codewars. One was about making sure boxes was labled correct and the other one was to get the middle character or the two middles depending if the number was even or odd.

**Thoughts**: It is a rushed day but I'm learning a lot. Future Kaio, please do all your habits in the morning. You're Welcome!

### Day 35: February 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the tutorial about creating objects in the canvas and animating it. I've learned about ES6 features about let, const and a bit of arrow functions. First time I got stuck on a challenge on FCC. I'm learning about higher order function as map(), filter(), and reduce().

**Thoughts**: I want to change what I've doing with the tutuorial. I think I understood the challenge but the thing I'm not sure is key to solving the problem. Maybe I didn't as much as I think.
