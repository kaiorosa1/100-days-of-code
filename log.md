# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on HTML and CSS on FreeCodeCamp. Finished the HTML Section and did some subsection on the Intro to CSS module. I learned about string function on MySQL and review DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts**: This is a refresher for me at least for now. I decided that I''ll be following FreeCodeCamp's route. Technically it's been weeks that I started coding every day but I start counting for today. I'm studying JavaScript on Udemy and a bit of MySQL. I'm very excited with this challenge and I hope to see great progress in my web dev/coding in general skills.

### Day 2: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I progressed with freeCodeCamp. I finished the section about the CSS basics. I reviewed about margin, padding, hexadecimal and rgb system and CSS variables and importance of fallbacks when it comes to CSS styling. Started working on a minesweeper in C. I only started reading the files to generate the table.

**Thoughts**: It was a bit overwhelming to finish all the module even though it was almost like a review session. I'll try to put my study session as early as possible. Since I'm on vacation I'll be continuing coding but it was not going to be as structure as I intend with this callenge. I want to be working on projects I'm starting that today. It's only simple to-do list in JS. My intention with this challenge is advance as far as I can,resonably, in freeCodeCamp.

### Day 3: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued reading the file tabuleiro.txt from Campo Minado (minesweeper).I did a couple of challenges from  the Applied Visual Design on FCC (FreeCodeCamp).

**Thoughts**: I started differently since I only had 30 minutes to work on something I decided to go with the project I began yesterday. It's a minesweeper but a simplified version. My intention with this project is to finish it according to a specification (I'll propably talk more about that later on). in the 30 minutes left, I worked on some FCC challenges. I did a couple of the Applied Visual Design one and took some notes as I'm usually doing. I intend to separate a day only for review everything I've been learning.

### Day 4: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I used one hour to go through Free Code Camp. I stopped at : Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element (Applied Visual Design). I worked on Campo Minado for 30 minutes mainly focusing on designing the data structure I'm going to be using.

**Thoughts**: The challenges are more fun and I'm confident that my CSS skills are getting better. Right now I'm not couting watching Udemy tutorial as work towards the challenge but I eventually will since I don't just watch tutorial, I code along and take notes and try to do myself as much as I can and most tutorial that I watch have follow up exercises which I do as well.

### Day 5: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on some Free Code Camp challenges for an hour. I stopped at : Applied Visual Design: Animate Elements at Variable Rates (Applied Visual Design). Coded more on Campo Minado.

**Thoughts**: It's been a crazy day. I don't know why but I don't seem to get focused.Fortunately I worked an hour on free code camp. The first time on my project that I have to think twice about what I'm doing. that's what coding is about.

### Day 6: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on the design aspect of the Campo Minado, meaning in what type of fuctions and the paramenters and testing the functions I created so far. I've spent an hour creating functions like print and allocation memory and making sure it's working the way I intentionally designed them. Also finsihed the section about applied visual and design and worked on some sections on the next section. I stopped at : Applied Accessibility: Improve Chart Accessibility with the figure Element (Applied Accessibility).

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I started this challenge I'm feeling very productive and I'm learning a lot by coding my project and using FCC. I'm not finding FCC as challenging yet but I'm sure when the projects come along and I go further down the line I'll have my fair share of wondering why I choose programming in the first place. Just kidding! Am I?

### Day 7: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent 30 minutes on Campo Minado and changed a bit some functions.  I worked around 40 minutes on FCC and finished the Applied Accessibility module. I stopped at : Responsive Web Design Principles: Create a Media Query (Responsive Web Design Principles).

**Thoughts**: I felt the my first session was not very productive and I didn't go as far as I wanted. It's a bit buggy my code my that's what happens when you are programming, not all your code is good from the get go. I'm feeling that I'm not making a lot of progress on FCC as I thought I would but it's because I make sure I read everything and take notes carefully before moving on to the next challenge or maybe I'm slow (no worries) lol.

### Day 8: February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started and finsihed the Responsive Web Design Principles.  I stopped at: CSS Flexbox: Use display: flex to Position Two Boxes (CSS Flexbox). I worked on Campo Minado with not much progress. I try to change how I was reading from the file. I decided to copy the file first and then I was going to change the 1s and 0s to the bombs and empty places.

**Thoughts**: I'm very excited that I'm two section to go to start working on project to apply everything I've learned so far. I'm also very excited to start working with CSS flexbox. I know I'm taking small steps towards finishing FCC but I think in this way I won't burn out quickly and I plan to start working more hours weeks from now. I hit a road block with Campo Minado and I have no idea how to solve the problem that I have so I'll use the rest of the time I planned searching and tweaking and coding. Good Luck to me!

### Day 9: February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Campo Minado and I implemented a bunch of function. It's printing the table completely and I calculated the neighbors bombs and everything. Worked as well on FCC problems for 30 minutes or so and I got back to Campo Minado and worked some more on implementing realizarJogada().

**Thoughts**: Through lots of researching and testing I found the bug and it was with allocating memory. It's always related to that when we are dealing with C. Feeling good about the progress I made and I worked for 2 hours + straight until I saw my progress flowing. Flexbox is very interesting and useful, I'm only at the beginning but I already like it.

### Day 10: February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished CSS Flexbox on FCC. It's much like reading documentation. Mainly worked on the final design of the final table of Campo Minado.

**Thoughts**: I feel that I'll learn more when I get to the projects. The challenges are fun but it's more like testing and reading documentation. I don't force myself to remember all those properties, I do take notes but I don't think I'll be able to remember everything I learned so far if I don't use it constanstly.

### Day 11: February 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've fishished the FCC section about CSS grid. It was fun and there are a phonebook of properties like the the other CSS sections. CSS grid is a easier way to format your elements and a very useful tool to have when dealing with responsiveness. I worked on the flood fill functionality of the minesweeper on Campo Minado. 

**Thoughts**: It was fun to learn this last section and now I get to work on 5 projects and I'll start them tomorrow or maybe later today. Following my schedule I'll work on Campo minado for a bit. I think I close to finishing Campo Minado. The flood fill function is not working a hundred percent but I'm confident enough that I can solve that by tomorrow.

### Day 12: February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the flood fill functionality of the Campo Minado with not much success. I worked on FCC Tribute Page. Mainly was creating the structure like divs and setting ids and changing colors of elements.

**Thoughts**: It's normal to  get stuck I know but it sucks every time it happens. I'm struggling to understand what is wrong with my code. I know where the bug is but I don't know how to fix it yet. Later today I'll go back to it. I'm realising that giving you this time constraint instead of a task one. It's been very refreshing and less frustating than working for 4 hours straight with no idea of what is going on. Now I'll go to FCC start my first project. Not worked as much as I inteded.

### Day 13: February 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the floodfill functionality and it finally worked. Also worked a bit on the Tribute Page (FCC project).

**Thoughts**: Motivation is something very fluctuating. I don't feel unmotivated but I do not feel motivated haha. I don't know if this makes sense. I'm glad I could make the Campo Minado work. On the tribute page was just some tweaks.

### Day 14: February 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I'm almost done with the Tribute Page. My project passed all the requirements but I still want to be working on  it to make it better and prettier. I wrote a readme on GitHub of the Campo Minado, it's a work in progress but it's something. Due to issues with C9 I haven't worked on Campo Minado as much. I implemented a function and changed some bits.

**Thoughts**: It's exciting to work with HTML and CSS because you can see the immediate result and there's something fun in that.

### Day 15: February 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked for 30 minutes on my Tribute Page and I was finally happy with the way it looked. It's simple but I liked the end result of it. I also created the restart game funcionality on Campo Minado and tested some edge cases so that I can solve them in my next session. 

**Thoughts**: I wanted to spend more time programing but unfortunately I can't but I'm making the most that I able to.

### Day 16: February 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I took a HTML Quiz on W3Schools website to review HTML tags and attributes. I started my second project from Free Code Camp (Survey Form) and I finished the backbone of the project. Next I'll be working on styling the page. I worked on Campo Minado and finally someone is able to win the game. Also, I created some function that will be implemented in the next sessions.

**Thoughts**: I'll start talking about the Udemy courses that I'm taking here as well. I won't be counting them as 100DaysOfCode time (for now)  but they are also work that I'm doing so I want to be writing about him as well. FCC is a lot of fun and it's exciting to be working on projects even though they are simple but you are really putting into use what you learned.

### Day 17: February 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Survey Page (FCC) I'm using this opportunity to use Bootstrap 4 on my project. It's not a requirement but I think it's a great opporutunity to play around with it and I think when you use bootstrap is easier to make a beautiful project. For the next session I'll be doing that. I also worked on Campo Minado. I focused on writing analiseJogo.txt and refined to write a file for each match of the game. 

**Thoughts**: It's fun and I think I'm getting a better idea of how long it takes me to build something. Campo Minado is almost at its finsih line and I can't wait to spend all my time in web dev projects. I want to be refining and bettering Campo Minado but I think that for my purpose I'm almost done. My purpose was to redo the project and see how I'd have done differently and I've been doing that.

### Day 18: February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Survey Page and I addeda a background image and rearrenged some code and added Bootstrap to my form. 

**Thoughts**: It will always take longer when you are learning things. I never say that in here but reading and searching are also very present in my sessions. I've been read the Bootstrap doc page to experiment with things in my survey but some of them did not end up in my final version for the day.
