# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Kaio Rosa

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 27, 2019.

## Log

### R1D1 
Worked on HTML and CSS on FreeCodeCamp. Finished the HTML Section and did some subsection on the Intro to CSS module. I learned about string function on MySQL and review DOM manipulation.

### R1D2

I progressed with freeCodeCamp. I finished the section about the CSS basics. I reviewed about margin, padding, hexadecimal and rgb system and CSS variables and importance of fallbacks when it comes to CSS styling. Started working on a minesweeper in C. I only started reading the files to generate the table.

### R1D3

Continued reading the file tabuleiro.txt from Campo Minado (minesweeper).I did a couple of challenges from  the Applied Visual Design on FCC (FreeCodeCamp).

### R1D4

I used one hour to go through Free Code Camp. I stopped at : Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element (Applied Visual Design). I worked on Campo Minado for 30 minutes mainly focusing on designing the data structure I'm going to be using.


### R1D5

I worked on some Free Code Camp challenges for an hour. I stopped at : Applied Visual Design: Animate Elements at Variable Rates (Applied Visual Design). Coded more on Campo Minado.

### R1D6

I've been working on the design aspect of the Campo Minado, meaning in what type of fuctions and the paramenters and testing the functions I created so far. I've spent an hour creating functions like print and allocation memory and making sure it's working the way I intentionally designed them. Also finsihed the section about applied visual and design and worked on some sections on the next section. I stopped at : Applied Accessibility: Improve Chart Accessibility with the figure Element (Applied Accessibility).

### R1D7

I spent 30 minutes on Campo Minado and changed a bit some functions. I worked around 40 minutes on FCC and finished the Applied Accessibility module. I stopped at : Responsive Web Design Principles: Create a Media Query (Responsive Web Design Principles).
 
### R1D8

Started and finsihed the Responsive Web Design Principles.  I stopped at: CSS Flexbox: Use display: flex to Position Two Boxes (CSS Flexbox). I worked on Campo Minado with not much progress. I try to change how I was reading from the file. I decided to copy the file first and then I was going to change the 1s and 0s to the bombs and empty places.

### R1D9

I worked on Campo Minado and I implemented a bunch of function. It's printing the table completely and I calculated the neighbors bombs and everything. Worked as well on FCC problems for 30 minutes or so and I got back to Campo Minado and worked some more on implementing realizarJogada().

### R1D10

I've finished CSS Flexbox on FCC. It's much like reading documentation. Mainly worked on the final design of the final table of Campo Minado.

### R1D11

I've fishished the FCC section about CSS grid. It was fun and there are a phonebook of properties like the the other CSS sections. CSS grid is a easier way to format your elements and a very useful tool to have when dealing with responsiveness. I worked on the flood fill functionality of the minesweeper on Campo Minado. 


### R1D12

I've worked on the flood fill functionality of the Campo Minado with not much success. I worked on FCC Tribute Page. Mainly was creating the structure like divs and setting ids and changing colors of elements.


### R1D13

I Worked on the floodfill functionality and it finally worked. Also worked a bit on the Tribute Page (FCC project).
 

### R1D14 

I'm almost done with the Tribute Page. My project passed all the requirements but I still want to be working on  it to make it better and prettier. I wrote a readme on GitHub of the Campo Minado, it's a work in progress but it's something. Due to issues with C9 I haven't worked on Campo Minado as much. I implemented a function and changed some bits.

### R1D15

I worked for 30 minutes on my Tribute Page and I was finally happy with the way it looked. It's simple but I liked the end result of it. I also created the restart game funcionality on Campo Minado and tested some edge cases so that I can solve them in my next session. 


### R1D16

I took an HTML Quiz on the W3Schools website to review HTML tags and attributes. I started my second project from Free Code Camp (Survey Form) and I finished the backbone of the project. Next I'll be working on styling the page. I worked on Campo Minado and finally someone is able to win the game. Also, I created some function that will be implemented in the next sessions.


### R1D17

Worked on Survey Page (FCC) I'm using this opportunity to use Bootstrap 4 on my project. It's not a requirement but I think it's a great opportunity to play around with it and I think when you use bootstrap is easier to make a beautiful project. For the next session I'll be doing that. I also worked on Campo Minado. I focused on writing analiseJogo.txt and refined to write a file for each match of the game.

### R1D18

I worked on the Survey Page and I added a background image and rearrenged some code and added Bootstrap to my form. I also worked on Campo Minado with not much progress it was generating buggy files and I had not idea how to fix them.

### R1D19

I worked on Campo Minado and solved the problem with the files and I made a big change on analiseJogo function. I've finished my second project on FCC, the survey form page. 

### R1D20 

I worked on Campo Minado and made some changes the way it was handling the floodfill algorithm. This part is working but it's not the way that I want.  Also, I worked on the third project from FCC (Product Landing Page). I only tackled the requirements but not all of them and then I'll be structuring everything to look nice.


### R1D21

I've worked on the nav bar in the Product Landing Page and I worked on Campo Minado freeing memory.

### R1D22

I worked on Campo Minado and I finally can say it's finished I'll be revisiting and refactoring and tweaking but all the functionality is done. I'm so proud of myself for finishing it. I've worked on the Product Landing Page and I decided that it was going to be about Khalid and I added Bootstrap to my project.

### R1D23 

I dedicated today to finish the Product Landing Page (FCC). I've read a lot and learned more about CSS Flexbox and I could use in a project and that made that much clear for me.
