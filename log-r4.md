### Day 4: November 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued the ZTM course on Udemy.Finished the CSS section and I'm at the end of the Advanced CSS section. I reviewed about the box model, flexbox, css transform and animation properties creating a fun mini project (code-along).

**Thoughts**: I'm very excited to be doing this course. I want to improve my frontend skills and I think having a solid CSS foundation is a start. I have been all over the place when it comes to what I want to do careerwise. I wanted to be a backend Java developer, a frontend developer a JS developer you name it. The only thing I'm certain (for now) that I want to be developing web appliations.

### Day 3: November 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued the ZTM course on Udemy. I'm almost finishing the CSS section. I need to review about the box model and about some properties before diving into the Advanced CSS section. So far it's been a really comprehensive review. To be fair I didn't know about the !important keyword that could be used in a css property.

**Thoughts**: So fun!! Sometimes I forget that I like programming and learning. My college career has been so frustating and filled with lack of motivation and unfair/ boring professors that I forget that I love learning and I actually enjoy the process of acquiring knowledge.

### Day 2: November 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued the ZTM course on Udemy. I finished the sections about HTML. It was more like a review than anything but it was worth it. It is never too much when it comes to refreshing the basics.

**Thoughts**: I can't wait to see how applying myself everyday for an hour for this challenge will change my perpective on web development. I already feel that I have a new approach to web dev comparing to the start of 2019.

### Day 1: November 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the ZTM course on Udemy again. I will finish this course this time. I feel like I know I'll learn a lot I just have to stick to it. I still have a lot of school things to do but the 100 Days Of Code will be for web dev because I need to get back to JS and React and all that good stuff again.

**Thoughts**: I took the first step now I will be web developing for the next 99 days!!!
