# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 2) 


### Day 1: May 07, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finally started to get serious about my React App. I love how everything is in this closed modules and 
you can add stuff to it. So exciting.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I decided to go for another round I know how much programming in general means to me and this 
is another change to ingrain this habit.

### Day 2: May 08, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the functionality on the Random Quote Machine project. I'm very happy that I was able to write my first React App from scratch. I'll be working on the styling for a bit.

**Thoughts**: Very fulfilling to be working on projects again. I want to finish the the Front End Libraries Certification in the next few weeks. It's been crazy how much is in my plate but I know coding is a passion worth sacrificing time. I see more like an investment in my carrer and in my sanity.

### Day 3: May 09, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the Random Quote Machine project on FCC. 

**Thoughts**: I'm glad with the final look of the project. It's a very simple project but I was able to use a lot of React concepts I've been learning so far.

---

### Day 4: May 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've started the Markdown Previewer project on FCC. I'll be using React in all of my FCC projects or At least I'm gonna try to do it. I also sort of refactor the Random Quote Machine code to match the code pen one so it opens on the browser.

**Thoughts**: The React syntax is coming to me slowly. I felt that I didn't know how to start a project and now I'm feeling confident tha the basic syntax is sinking in.

---


### Day 5: May 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've continued working on the Markdown Previewer. I spent a lot of time reading documentation and tutorials about the passing data between sibling components. 

**Thoughts**: The more I use React the more I get more impressed and see how beautiful it is. I want to become an awesome React developer. I'll learn Angular though and I think they follow some principles I have to look this up. I have so many I ideas I want to build the game store from the last module in php. I want to become proficient in php as well since I'm already learning it on my IT techinician course (don't know how to translate it better lol).

---

### Day 6: May 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've continued working on the Markdown Previewer. I'm not sure how to use the Marked.js in my project. I know it is easier than to parse the markdown myself. Doing project we're able to see a lot of gaps in our knowlegde and I feel great that I making this gap smaller. We face hardship but we come out stronger! 

I've got it. I've figured out how to use the Marked.js functions into my code. Now I'm closer to finsish this project.

**Thoughts**: This project is being more intersting because I get to read documentation from a JS library that I have no idea how it works. I hope that I become a more skilled developer in the way. I can't believe it's been 6 days already and I'm so glad I didn't stop. I still have so much to learn and master that I don't get to not work towards my dreams. I know it sounds bad but I mean in the best way possible.

---

### Day 7: May 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've continued working on the Markdown Previewer. I still have two requirements to make my project good to go and when I mean good to go I only mean the project requirements are met. The tests which my project fail were about a default text that must be in the page right when the pages load. Also watched some React tutorials.


**Thoughts**: It's not that the requirements are even challenging but it's because they are a bit tricky since I have to make the preview text be marked but the function is only called when there is change in the editor. Academind is a great resourse to learn React. To this point I think they have the best one, in my opinion.

---

### Day 8: May 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Contunued working on the Markdown Previewer. Finally when I put the default text it's rendered by the Marked js library (I don't know if it's how this works). I need to make them meet the requirements to pass all the tests. I did in the second session today.

**Thoughts**: It's very important to read a lot when you are stuck and try to change your code carefully. I hope I can finish this project by tomorrow or in a few days because I will be working on the styling and looks of it.

---

### Day 9: May 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the Markdown Previewer. I'm focusing on the styling. I have to make some decision about the layout and design. This is not where I shine.

**Thoughts**: I want to be done with all this project for me to done with the frontend stuff. I feel like the backend is gonna be more interesting and I'll be better at it.(hopefully)

---

### Day 10: May 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the Markdown Previewer. I focused on finished the layout aspect of it. I finally finished another project. There are still 3 to go.

**Thoughts**: Having better design intuition is not as trivial as it may seem.

### Day 11: May 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started the Drum Machine project. It's always very time-consuming when setting up everything and changes you need to make for things to work properly. Today I also changed the quotes in my Random Quote Machine, for obvious reasons.

**Thoughts**: I'm very happy because I have exciting news. I'm very excited for this project because I'll be able to use DOM manipulation (I know I've already been doning that) and there's gonna be audio and probably animation so a lot of new things to get my hands dirty.

---

### Day 12: May 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have coded a bit more on the Drum Machine project, I'm now deciding what it is gonna be a compoment itself or not. I'm first making sure I follow the User stories first and then my project's gonna take its own shape.

**Thoughts**: Designing is the hardest part and in theory I love thinking about the components and everything but in practice I feel that is very time-demanding and it should be but for my mini projects I like to get my hands dirty because I already have the step by step to follow. I love freeCodeCamp and I can stress this enough I feel that changed my mindset for the better when it comes to coding and creating stuff.

---

### Day 13: May 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've coded on the Drum Machine project. I created new Components because I think it's gonna be use to manage the functionality I want to implement. Visually it's the same but I will obviously change that later on.

**Thoughts**: When I made my 100 Days of Code plans I didn't include days where I would be reading more code than actually coding. I think you get better at planing with time.

### Day 14: May 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: In the first session I worked on the display and I started working on the audio part. I need to find free audios to use in my project. In the second session I've tested one audio and it was working. Now I have to find copyright free audios to use.

**Thoughts**: There are days that are very hard to code and I ask myself if I made the right choice joining this challenge. Today is one of those days. I have a big exam tomorrow and I need to be studying for that and I also need to go to my course.

---

### Day 15: May 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the Drum Machine and I focused on the pad and added audio to each key. I worked on the pad functionality. 

**Thoughts**: It gets harder and harder by the day. I need to start coding earlier in the day. Fighting Kaio!!

### Day 16: May 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the Drum Machine and got stuck with the key pressing part. There a test that it's been bugging me because it's doing what is need and I don't know how to fix it and in the other hand the key pressing is not even working. Very frustating and  I also have a headache !

**Thoughts**: Oh my, I have no motivation to continue this challenge, I don't see my progress and I think I'vetuck with this boring project for 3 days already. Sometimes it is not fun at all and I also I have a ton to be worried in my school. It's already feeling like a regret restarting this challenge. Let's see how this will go in the next days.

---

### Day 17: May 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on solving that but and it turns out I wasn't selecting all the audios in the dum pad so it made impossible to find because I put the same audio in all of them.I gladly solved that buy making all of the audios visible and playing one by one.  Now I have to work on the styling of the drum because right now it's ugly as eff

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I was very frustated about everything but I feel better today I am glad I'm encoutering all this hurdle in my way because this mean I will become a better software developer and better than that a better problem solver, one thing I'll never take for granted is the power of experience. I need to learn a lot but I also can see that experiencing programming as a habit I feel more confident to tackle all of the future problems I know it's gonna be frustating and disheartening sometimes but I'll get through it I always do.

---

### Day 18: May 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I focused on the styling and structuring the project. I don't have any idea how I want it to look like so I'm playing a bit with its appearance.

**Thoughts**: Procastination is a killer and you have to beware of it ALWAYS. Create systems that make you less likely to procastinate because the BITCH is coming at you whether you like it or not. lol.

---

### Day 19: May 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on finishing the Drum Machine. I liked the final result, but to be honest I always do when I finish but days later I want to go back and change everything. I also started working on the JS Calculator.

**Thoughts**: It is very good to be finishing projects gives you a sense of purpose and I believe that's why I love freeCodeCamp you always have a chance to put into practice the lessons you've finished before. I'm feeling myself getting a better developer and I can't wait to finish all the certifications. In the ideal world I'd be finishing the my third certification before the day 30 but I won't rush when I'm done I'm done it's all about the journey. I also want to be redoing some projects in the future because I know feel much more confident working with those technologies.

---

### Day 20: May 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I designed the components and started working on the functionality a little bit. So I've been trying to follow the same steps I've done for the last three projects. I create the compoments then I link them if needed and then I start implement the functionality and I'm now in the functionality part.

**Thoughts**: It gets more challenging the projects but that's the fun of it.

---

### Day 21: May 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the display features, when a number is clicked in the calculator pad they show up in the display. Now I have to work in a way that makes them concatenate the numbers and then recognize the operations and make them work.

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately I spend a lot of time in these 21 days regreting to start the 2nd round, I was not intentionally doing that but I realise this held me back a little. I want to spend more time being mindful and feeling great that I can keep up with this habit. I have a lot of plans and I feel very excited thinking about executing them and I can't say that about a lot of things in my life lately, dark I know but I don't mean that way. Go React! Go projects! Go Web Development! Go becoming a better developer! And in consequence being a better Kaio.

---

### Day 22: May 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started working on the sum functionality. I know it sounds like it should be simple but I need to figure out how to get the second number after the opetation sign is clicked. 

**Thoughts**: I'm very tired because I had to little sleep so I think this can be the reason I don't feel as motivated but I worked on it. Some days I'm just glad it is over. lol Don't take me wrong but I feel tired and I want to be doing other things and I still have other things to do.

---

### Day 23: May 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the setOperation function that gets the first number and the oprerator clicked so I can be able to handle it properly. Naming functions are very hard and every time I'm doing a project I see the consequences of not planning ahead. I need to start planning before coding I know it. The addition is working now!

**Thoughts**: It's a very good day and I feel I'm making progress in my project. I wish I could be faster and make better quality projects but I feel I don't put as much time as I need to be doing that. I'm taking this serious but at the same time I feel that I'm not doing enough but I'm settling for consitency because I already can see the results but I wish I started this coding routine sooner, unfortunately I say a lot that in my life.
