# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 2) 


### Day 1: May 07, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finally started to get serious about my React App. I love how everything is in this closed modules and 
you can add stuff to it. So exciting.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I decided to go for another round I know how much programming in general means to me and this 
is another change to ingrain this habit.

---

### Day 2: May 08, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the functionality on the Random Quote Machine project. I'm very happy that I was able to write my first React App from scratch. I'll be working on the styling for a bit.

**Thoughts**: Very fulfilling to be working on projects again. I want to finish the the Front End Libraries Certification in the next few weeks. It's been crazy how much is in my plate but I know coding is a passion worth sacrificing time. I see more like an investment in my carrer and in my sanity.

---

### Day 3: May 09, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the Random Quote Machine project on FCC. 

**Thoughts**: I'm glad with the final look of the project. It's a very simple project but I was able to use a lot of React concepts I've been learning so far.

---

### Day 4: May 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've started the Markdown Previewer project on FCC. I'll be using React in all of my FCC projects or At least I'm gonna try to do it. I also sort of refactor the Random Quote Machine code to match the code pen one so it opens on the browser.

**Thoughts**: The React syntax is coming to me slowly. I felt that I didn't know how to start a project and now I'm feeling confident tha the basic syntax is sinking in.

---


### Day 5: May 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've continued working on the Markdown Previewer. I spent a lot of time reading documentation and tutorials about the passing data between sibling components. 

**Thoughts**: The more I use React the more I get more impressed and see how beautiful it is. I want to become an awesome React developer. I'll learn Angular though and I think they follow some principles I have to look this up. I have so many I ideas I want to build the game store from the last module in php. I want to become proficient in php as well since I'm already learning it on my IT techinician course (don't know how to translate it better lol).

---

### Day 6: May 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've continued working on the Markdown Previewer. I'm not sure how to use the Marked.js in my project. I know it is easier than to parse the markdown myself. Doing project we're able to see a lot of gaps in our knowlegde and I feel great that I making this gap smaller. We face hardship but we come out stronger! 

I've got it. I've figured out how to use the Marked.js functions into my code. Now I'm closer to finsish this project.

**Thoughts**: This project is being more intersting because I get to read documentation from a JS library that I have no idea how it works. I hope that I become a more skilled developer in the way. I can't believe it's been 6 days already and I'm so glad I didn't stop. I still have so much to learn and master that I don't get to not work towards my dreams. I know it sounds bad but I mean in the best way possible.

---

### Day 7: May 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've continued working on the Markdown Previewer. I still have two requirements to make my project good to go and when I mean good to go I only mean the project requirements are met. The tests which my project fail were about a default text that must be in the page right when the pages load. Also watched some React tutorials.


**Thoughts**: It's not that the requirements are even challenging but it's because they are a bit tricky since I have to make the preview text be marked but the function is only called when there is change in the editor. Academind is a great resourse to learn React. To this point I think they have the best one, in my opinion.

---

### Day 8: May 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Contunued working on the Markdown Previewer. Finally when I put the default text it's rendered by the Marked js library (I don't know if it's how this works). I need to make them meet the requirements to pass all the tests. I did in the second session today.

**Thoughts**: It's very important to read a lot when you are stuck and try to change your code carefully. I hope I can finish this project by tomorrow or in a few days because I will be working on the styling and looks of it.

---

### Day 9: May 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the Markdown Previewer. I'm focusing on the styling. I have to make some decision about the layout and design. This is not where I shine.

**Thoughts**: I want to be done with all this project for me to done with the frontend stuff. I feel like the backend is gonna be more interesting and I'll be better at it.(hopefully)

---

### Day 10: May 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the Markdown Previewer. I focused on finished the layout aspect of it. I finally finished another project. There are still 3 to go.

**Thoughts**: Having better design intuition is not as trivial as it may seem.

---

### Day 11: May 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started the Drum Machine project. It's always very time-consuming when setting up everything and changes you need to make for things to work properly. Today I also changed the quotes in my Random Quote Machine, for obvious reasons.

**Thoughts**: I'm very happy because I have exciting news. I'm very excited for this project because I'll be able to use DOM manipulation (I know I've already been doning that) and there's gonna be audio and probably animation so a lot of new things to get my hands dirty.

---

### Day 12: May 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have coded a bit more on the Drum Machine project, I'm now deciding what it is gonna be a compoment itself or not. I'm first making sure I follow the User stories first and then my project's gonna take its own shape.

**Thoughts**: Designing is the hardest part and in theory I love thinking about the components and everything but in practice I feel that is very time-demanding and it should be but for my mini projects I like to get my hands dirty because I already have the step by step to follow. I love freeCodeCamp and I can stress this enough I feel that changed my mindset for the better when it comes to coding and creating stuff.

---

### Day 13: May 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've coded on the Drum Machine project. I created new Components because I think it's gonna be use to manage the functionality I want to implement. Visually it's the same but I will obviously change that later on.

**Thoughts**: When I made my 100 Days of Code plans I didn't include days where I would be reading more code than actually coding. I think you get better at planing with time.

---

### Day 14: May 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: In the first session I worked on the display and I started working on the audio part. I need to find free audios to use in my project. In the second session I've tested one audio and it was working. Now I have to find copyright free audios to use.

**Thoughts**: There are days that are very hard to code and I ask myself if I made the right choice joining this challenge. Today is one of those days. I have a big exam tomorrow and I need to be studying for that and I also need to go to my course.

---

### Day 15: May 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the Drum Machine and I focused on the pad and added audio to each key. I worked on the pad functionality. 

**Thoughts**: It gets harder and harder by the day. I need to start coding earlier in the day. Fighting Kaio!!

---

### Day 16: May 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on the Drum Machine and got stuck with the key pressing part. There a test that it's been bugging me because it's doing what is need and I don't know how to fix it and in the other hand the key pressing is not even working. Very frustating and  I also have a headache !

**Thoughts**: Oh my, I have no motivation to continue this challenge, I don't see my progress and I think I'vetuck with this boring project for 3 days already. Sometimes it is not fun at all and I also I have a ton to be worried in my school. It's already feeling like a regret restarting this challenge. Let's see how this will go in the next days.

---

### Day 17: May 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on solving that but and it turns out I wasn't selecting all the audios in the dum pad so it made impossible to find because I put the same audio in all of them.I gladly solved that buy making all of the audios visible and playing one by one.  Now I have to work on the styling of the drum because right now it's ugly as eff

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I was very frustated about everything but I feel better today I am glad I'm encoutering all this hurdle in my way because this mean I will become a better software developer and better than that a better problem solver, one thing I'll never take for granted is the power of experience. I need to learn a lot but I also can see that experiencing programming as a habit I feel more confident to tackle all of the future problems I know it's gonna be frustating and disheartening sometimes but I'll get through it I always do.

---

### Day 18: May 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I focused on the styling and structuring the project. I don't have any idea how I want it to look like so I'm playing a bit with its appearance.

**Thoughts**: Procastination is a killer and you have to beware of it ALWAYS. Create systems that make you less likely to procastinate because the BITCH is coming at you whether you like it or not. lol.

---

### Day 19: May 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on finishing the Drum Machine. I liked the final result, but to be honest I always do when I finish but days later I want to go back and change everything. I also started working on the JS Calculator.

**Thoughts**: It is very good to be finishing projects gives you a sense of purpose and I believe that's why I love freeCodeCamp you always have a chance to put into practice the lessons you've finished before. I'm feeling myself getting a better developer and I can't wait to finish all the certifications. In the ideal world I'd be finishing the my third certification before the day 30 but I won't rush when I'm done I'm done it's all about the journey. I also want to be redoing some projects in the future because I know feel much more confident working with those technologies.

---

### Day 20: May 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I designed the components and started working on the functionality a little bit. So I've been trying to follow the same steps I've done for the last three projects. I create the compoments then I link them if needed and then I start implement the functionality and I'm now in the functionality part.

**Thoughts**: It gets more challenging the projects but that's the fun of it.

---

### Day 21: May 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the display features, when a number is clicked in the calculator pad they show up in the display. Now I have to work in a way that makes them concatenate the numbers and then recognize the operations and make them work.

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately I spend a lot of time in these 21 days regreting to start the 2nd round, I was not intentionally doing that but I realise this held me back a little. I want to spend more time being mindful and feeling great that I can keep up with this habit. I have a lot of plans and I feel very excited thinking about executing them and I can't say that about a lot of things in my life lately, dark I know but I don't mean that way. Go React! Go projects! Go Web Development! Go becoming a better developer! And in consequence being a better Kaio.

---

### Day 22: May 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started working on the sum functionality. I know it sounds like it should be simple but I need to figure out how to get the second number after the opetation sign is clicked. 

**Thoughts**: I'm very tired because I had to little sleep so I think this can be the reason I don't feel as motivated but I worked on it. Some days I'm just glad it is over. lol Don't take me wrong but I feel tired and I want to be doing other things and I still have other things to do.

---

### Day 23: May 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the setOperation function that gets the first number and the oprerator clicked so I can be able to handle it properly. Naming functions are very hard and every time I'm doing a project I see the consequences of not planning ahead. I need to start planning before coding I know it. The addition is working now!

**Thoughts**: It's a very good day and I feel I'm making progress in my project. I wish I could be faster and make better quality projects but I feel I don't put as much time as I need to be doing that. I'm taking this serious but at the same time I feel that I'm not doing enough but I'm settling for consitency because I already can see the results but I wish I started this coding routine sooner, unfortunately I say a lot that in my life.

---

### Day 24: May 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the JavaScript Calculator project and I worked on the rest basic operations like, multiplication and division. Now the challenge is saving all of the operation so independently of how many times the user multiply or sum the numbers they get the correct answer once they click in the equals sign.

**Thoughts**: I made a lot of progress today but due to poor planning I had to change a lot of the code. It's great though that I'm learning a lot about React. before the first project I didn't know how to create a component and now I getting the hang of states and passing function and props to other component and all of that good stuff.

---

### Day 25: May 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've focused on the JS Calculator and I spend my time on solving the issue of doing more than one operation in a row. Getting to solved that I found other challenges to the approach I was taking. I tend to be frustated quite often but I know it's just me talking me down and this doesn't help me at all it only demotivates me. 

**Thoughts**: I love coding and all but I often feel underappreciated in this field and I don't know what I am doing wrong am I that bad? I feel that people in worse position is doing better than I am. Anyway this  is my rambly about how the tech field isn't as fair as I like to think. But maybe this is just me frustated with the fact that I'm not good enough, but when will I be? Good question that I have no answer for now. I'll continue what I'm doing and trying to improve myself because that's what I have control over.

---

### Day 26: June 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I focused on the JS Calculator project. I decided to step back for a bit and take the approach of design first. I've been stuck for the past days and I think is due to poor planning, so I'll restart this project (sort of). 

**Thoughts**: This second round has been very slow and a bit frustating. I have so much I want to do but unfortunaly everything is falling through the cracks. I need to bush up on my Java skills because I know I'll be using a lot of that in the future. I remember that in the beginning I was very hesitant on the idea of working on another language besides JavaScript but right now to be honest I take what I get. Of course I want to become better at NodeJS but it's even better if I can be a good developer so I must be language agnostic.

---

### Day 27: June 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I made some changes with my last hope to fix the current project but then I forked it and started making the changes I thought it was necessary. 

**Thoughts**: An hour is not as much time as it seems and I have to aware of that when thinking I haven't made progress or I am really bad at time management (I can see that) but I think people often overestimate what can be done in an hour.

---

### Day 28: June 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I decided that today I'd be focusing on my portifolio. I don't have many portifolio worthy projects, so I'm refactoring some old ones that can showcase my programming skills. 

**Thoughts**: Marketing yourself is a very hard process. I know I don't have a great portfolio but I'm very dedicated and focused, to be fair I haven't applied to many companies but I feel that I have more to offer than I'm showing off.

---


### Day 29: June 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I've changed some props and state in my calculator component. I hope this new approach I taking gets me to finishing this project soon. The JS Calculator is not as hard as it might seem for reading my log haha, I think it's because I've been taking the wrong approach all this time.

**Thoughts**: It's a brand new day and It's good to be producing and coding.

---


### Day 30: June 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I changed the logic a little bit to make two arrays one for the operations and one for the numbers so it was easy to keep track of the total. It worked and I'm glad I could find this solution. 

**Thoughts**: It's finaily finished in terms of functionality, now I have to focus on some specific requirements to meet the user stories.

---


### Day 31: June 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the JS Calculator (FCC). Oh my I thought it would be smooth from here, boy I was wrong! I don't now why a simple project like that is giving me so much trouble.

**Thoughts**: I found a bug and I fixed it, sort of, and I create another one. I'm on the way to fix it.

---

### Day 32: June 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I finsihed the JS Calculator. I worked on everything from the functionality to the final look of the project. I'm really proud of this one. I got help from my sister to look this good!

**Thoughts**: I feel that it's been so long since I started this project and now I finallly finished the hard work and I'm moving on the light stuff. This round has been all about expectations vs reality for me, I have a note where I tried to be specific about what I wanted to accomplish in this 2nd round but now I see that I might have been too ambitious. I think the backend stuff is gonna be smoother but let's see, I've learned so much about me and the way I function that it's been worth it for that reason already.

### Day 33: June 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started to work on the last project of this certification which is the Pomodoro Clock. Today I designed the components and started programing a bit trying to meet some of the user stories on FCC. I also started a project in Java, it's an old school project that I want to spicy it up a bit haha. 

**Thoughts**: I have so much on my plate right now but I like to think that I have everything under control, I have two assignmets due two days from today and I'm not even close to finish either of them but I still decided to code for 2 hours today because I need to make my portfolio better since I haven't heard back from the internships I applied recently.

---

### Day 34: June 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: In my first session I've worked on the Pomodoro Calculator (FCC). My main focus was on the user stories, I was able to finish the content part however this project has a lot more requirements and they are divided within content, timer and audio. 

**Thoughts**: When we start a project we don't see all of the challenges at first but they soon creep in and you become to have a more holistic view of what's yet to come.

I've been putting on the back burner to write about my first round of the 100 Days of Code, I don't know if I have the fresh perpective anymore since I'm more than a quarter way done with the second round but I want to do it anyway, maybe I can even talk about expectation vs reality about this challenge.

---

### Day 35: June 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I  worked on the SistemaCredenciamentoPPGI project, I'm using this opportunity to code more in java since I'll be doing a more of that in the future and it would be nice to have a project in java that I can put in my portfolio. Intend to do the GUI and connect with a database so it's gonna be a full project, the only thing is that is not a web based application but I think this doesn't matter for now.

**Thoughts**: Let's get coding in Java, I want to do React but I think a day off doesn't hurt.

---

### Day 36: June 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Pomodoro Clock, I redesigned some components and start working on the timer but It's not working yet.

**Thoughts**: I think working a day in one project and a day in the other might be the way to make progress in both, let's see.

### Day 37: June 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started working on reading the Docentes file and creating the object to store the data from the file read. 

**Thoughts**: I have a lot going on right now and it would be nice to have been more organized !! :(

### Day 38: June 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've fixed some bugs on the Java project and now I'm moving on to read the rest of the files. 

**Thoughts**: The tricky part about reading the files is that I need to account for some inconsistency from the bat and sometimes it takes me a minute to solve this issues I encounter. At the end of the day I'll be creating a GUI and I'll get the user input from that.

### Day 39: June 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent yesterday and today working on the Java project and I think I made substancial progress. I'm reading all of the files and now I have to work on the output files necessary. Then I intend to work on the GUI of the system.

**Thoughts**: Today was a very productive day I worked most on the Java project and now I'm half way in the current project.

### Day 40: June 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the Java project and I changed the order of which I was reading the files so that I can read lista de Qualificacoes easier, and also I started writing one of the output files (1-recadastramento.csv) and that means I have to create additional function to my classes to make retreiving information about them smoother.

**Thoughts**: If you were to tell me how this round was going to be I wouldn't have said that I'd still be working on the Front End  Certification by now, to fair I haven't focus only on those particular projects but still. I need to be focusing more on backend stuff and I hope to start doing that soon. I think people in general has a wrong idea of how front end actually works, it's a lof of planning and very challenging, maybe in the early internet it was very easy and intuitive but nowadays it is very intricate.

### Day 41: June 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked for hours in the Pomodoro Clock with no much success. It's frustating but I know these days happen from time to time. I don't know if it's better to start from scratch or try to figure out this problem or if it's really worth it. Anyway I hope later today or tomorrow I can see things clear because right now I'm just frustated and tired.

**Thoughts**: I'm stuck in the Pomodoro Clock, I think it's too much state to be handling now I understand why a state management system like Redux is necessary because it's too confusing and overwhelming to be working around and connecting all of these components and all. I want so bad to finish this project to move on to the backend stuff. I do want to learn more React and all but I feel it will be better to move to other seas.

### Day 42: June 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Some days I like to use divide my session. Today the first one I worked on the Pomodoro Clock, I implemented one functionality and the second one with the Java project.

**Thoughts**: I have to remember that coding is a hobbie for now I have a lot going on in my school right now so I won't pressure myself as much to be at some place even now that I'm close to the end of this semester.

### Day 43: June 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finished write the first of three reports that I still don't know if I'll write a cvs file or I'm going to display it in a GUI later on in this project. For now I'm just printing the information.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I couldn't found out why the sum of points for the professors were wrong and today I only revisited the description of the problem and I solved it very quickly. It's funny that we take for granted being rested and our difuse way of thinking, I hope I can be this clear-minded when it comes to the Pomodoro as well. I've been very demotivated to work on that one.

---

### Day 44: June 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Pomodoro Clock and I finally changed some states and functions because the way they were before made my life harder and they were not clean code. So in my two sessions today I focused on getting to same point functionalitywise to I was before with this new changes. 

**Thoughts**: I hope I can make good progress today with this new components and everything. I also saw videos on Java EE because I want to start using Java for web development. I'll be focusing on NodeJS and Express when I start the new API and whatnot course on FCC but I will also be working on progressing a Web Plugin in Java in the next few month and I think this is a good way to push myself to start learning more about that.

---

### Day 45: June 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Java project and I wrote the last functionality for now. This project is system where you can register professors in this department.  You have a set of requirements that dictate the threshold so they can be renewed in this graduate program. Now I'll be focusing on the GUI aspect of it. I also worked on the Pomodoro Clock later on.

**Thoughts**: This system can be a great opportunity for me to put in practice my MySQL skills. I know that I'm following a strange path from the program to the database. I don't know I think the database design should be one of the first things, I'm gonna be doing that just for fun. I'm not sure if I'll be implementing all CRUD for this project yet but more on that later, now it's time for the GUI.

### Day 46: June 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Today I worked on the Java Project. I started working in the GUI, so I was planning and at the same time learning how to set the components properly.

**Thoughts**: So many things happening right now I would love to have a greater sense of progress. I've been applying to a lot of companies lately and it's a bit saddening to not hear back from them. Ok some of them are exactly a week old but either way I feel that it would be nice to hear that they at least received my CV. To  be fair one of them did.  These companies are often saying how much they like to give feedback and whatnot but I think most of them don't even respect the very people in their hiring process.

### Day 47: June 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on the Pomodoro Clock. I mostly tried new ways of solving the issue with the timer. I discovered that it didn't have anything to do with clearing the interval like I expected before and I can see that the reset button is not reseting everything.

**Thoughts**: A bit frustating to be working in this project for so long and not go anywhere for the past week or so. I'll be working on more on that tomorrow I need to find a solution or start from scratch because I'm feeling like I'm never going to finish this project. Fighting Kaio!!! I know I can solve this and finish this project but still it feels like a never ending battle with React components.

### Day 48: June 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on the Java project which is the SistemaDeRecadastramentoPPGI. I created more JFrames, working on the GUI using Netbeans is very easy since you only need to drag and drop but it's been a bit challenging because I need to think how I'm going to get the necessary information from the database so I have to have the right components in the GUI. It's very menial but it takes a bit of time and I'm not rushing it just to feel that I'm doing more with my time.

**Thoughts**: It's been very tiring this semester I've been so demotivated with everything and burntout, I was very motivated to get my coding skills sharp and to work with interesting projects but unfortuanately when I don't have energy and I'm very low I encounter a not working project and another one which I don't know what direction should I go. Should I use this project to use MySQL like I orinally planned or should I left the project the way it is and start working on more clallenging/interesting projects? I don't know what I do know that I'm drained with school and I'm honestly hopeless with my results. I know I get this way when finals are coming but when I get better I often forget how it was the last term. Anyway, I will continue coding everyday cuz I need/ want to be a fantastic software engineer and the only way to get there is by practicing and practicing and practicing. Let's get coding Kaio!!!

### Day 49: June 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Today I worked on the Java Project, I finished the CadastroQualificacao.java GUI and also renamed the field names to make it easier later on when I need to get their values. I review some MySQL as well.

**Thoughts**: I don't often read what I write but it's terapeutic to me. I'm gonna be reveiw some MySQL and solivng some logic problems to shapen my skills.

### Day 50: June 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  today I worked more on the Java Project and I focused on connecting it to the database. I've done this before but I was not remembering how to do it, so  I spent some time on that and also created the classes to test if the connection is really being done. Now I have to design the database, I don't know if I'll do it all at once or I'll do it in small sizes so it's cohesive with the already created forms (Probably all  at once cuz it is more organized).

**Thoughts**: I also have to prepare myself for a current interview/ test I'm not quite sure yet. I think it involves some database knoledge and I'll brush up on my algorithms and datastructures. Being honest I feel I need more time to prepare but I'll do the best as I can with the time I have, the last time I had one of these I had no idea about sorting algorithms or big oh or anything related to that for that matter so I hope I'm in a better position now even if I'm not gonna be as prepared as I want to.

### Day 51: June 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on the Java project again. I worked on the salvarDocente function which is the function that's gonna be inserting a Docente into the database. A lot of new stuff since I'm not completely fluent in MySQL yet.

**Thoughts**: I have an interview in a few hours so I'm splitting into two separate session today. I probably write a bit about my experience with that.

---

### Day 52: June 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on the Java project. Now I've done pretty much the same I did for the Docente to the Veiculo one. Once I'm finished with this one it becomes harder because I'll be dealing with foreign keys and whatnot.

**Thoughts**: It's fun when working on a project goes smoothly but at the same time I feel like I should go back to the Pomodoro one because I want to finish it and maybe I'm just avoiding being unconfortable and having to think deeply about the problem at hand. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/SistemaCredenciamentoPPGI/commit/09e7414a52affb77c47b3eaa93300224a7ee0a7d)

---

### Day 53: June 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the Java project so I made some changes in the database and worked on the Publicacao register form. I already forsee some challenges I'm gonna be dealing with but it's a good thing since the main point of these projects is to learn more.

**Thoughts**: A very overwhelming week but so far so good. I have a lot to say but it is not the place for some more personal things. I need to get back to the Pomodoro since it's been almost a week that I worked on it.

---

### Day 54: June 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the Java project, I focused on creating and implementing the listarDocentes function, I'm learning a lot about mysql and connection my application to a database.

**Thoughts**: I procrastinated a lot today I have no excuses but I'm gonna forgive myself I have a lot going on right now.

### Day 55: June 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finally worked on the Pomodoro Clock (FCC) finally I think it's going to work well. It had a bug that I didn't pay attention to and I took me so long to figure this out. I still like React and I want to get better at it.

**Thoughts**: I intend to focus on finishing this project because I'm not feeling good with how long it took me to solve this bug.
I've seen that my summaries are very brief lately haha. Most of the time this is only a snippet of what I actually done.

---

### Day 56: July 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the Pomodoro Clock (FCC), I spent my time trying to solve a specific problem but I was not able to solve it. The breaks are not working properly and I don't know if it's possible to do what I want to do in React. 

**Thoughts**: I know that my components were badly designed but I don't know how to do better and I don't want to redo it from scratch now maybe later this year but right now I want to finish it to move on the learn more backend stuff. I know that maybe if I started from scratch I would be done sooner or maybe not. I will definitely work on this project again later on. I want to get better at React and its intricacies.

### Day 57: July 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the Java project because I needed to work on the listarDocentes method. This is a method that will be necessary in the cadastrarPublicacoes. I also worked a bit on the Pomodoro Clock.

**Thoughts**: I'm still getting used to not having to go to my night course and I have so much going on that I'm not really enjoying nor my new freedom (for now) nor the accomplishment for being done with my IT technician course. I'll be on vacation soon and being honest I don't want to be because that  would meant that I was done being a student and having these type of vacations.

---

### Day 58: July 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Java project and it was mainly on the listarVeiculo function. The way I see is that it's very hard to get caught up with some of the details for example I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to set or get the right value from the database.

**Thoughts**: Today was so full and I'm so overwhelmed I have a lot of thing to do and on top of everything my computer is not working properly and I have to use my phone's data to use github and some of the websites. It's so stressful when things like that happen.

---

### Day 59: July 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Java project, mainly trying to display the data from the database to the combo boxes.

**Thoughts**: I have a big exam tomorrow and I am not acting like it. When we are in this stage of the semester it feels like everything is falling apart.

### Day 60: July 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Java project. I fixed a bug and implemented the listing Autores functionality to the GUI.

**Thoughts**: I'm so tired because I had almost no sleep today but at the same time I feel happy with the circunstances. I had an important exam and I hope I did well and I finally got rid of the virus that wasn't letting me access some websites for the past few days so a win-win situation.

### Day 61: July 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Pomodoro Clock and I finally finsished it. I can't believe I still need to work on the UI but all the user stories are met so I can submit it anytime. I will be working on the UI and then I get to work on the next certification.

**Thoughts**: Feeling really good about being able to make this project work, I think it's a simple project but I made a lot of wrong design approaches and it cost me days trying to figure out ways to make it work. Today I decided to redo from scratch and I was able to finish in a few hours. I know that I have the problem very clear in my head and that helped me to work quicker but still, this means that I could've been easier from the get-go if I had designed better.

### Day 62: July 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Java project, I focused on linking the right objects. Now when I select in the CadastroPublicacoes GUI it is associating the right object in the Publicacoes being saved. I also started working on the APIs and Microservices Certification.

**Thoughts**: I love the 100DaysOfCode community, I'm always overwhelmed with positive reiforcement and I feel very inspired seeing other people succeed in this field. I'm so grateful for being part of it. I said that before but I never felt so included and welcomed in a community, so much positivity and support in this long and harduous journey.

### Day 63: July 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Java project, I focused on finishing the cadastroPublicacao function but it's not saving in a database. Also worked on some FCC challenges.

**Thoughts**: It's gonna be a hectic week but I'm somewhat motivated to continue working on my side projects.

### Day 64: July 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Java project now I'm getting the information from the Qualificacao GUI. I also worked on some FCC challenges. 

**Thoughts**: Oh my  gosh, I've seen better days. Not all bad though I graduated in my IT Technician course (not the exact name). I want this day to end but I have an exam tomorrow that I have to study so badly.

### Day 65: July 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Java project, in the GUIs and also worked on some FCC challenges, I started the Node and Express basic section.

**Thoughts**: I procratinated a bit today but it was a better day I feel I can recover from bad days quite easily I know things are never as bad as they seen and I can't get through them even when I don't really believe that which is now lol. Coding-wise I worked more on the GUIs, getting the right values from them. I know it seems very trivial but some of them are only possible to work with if I get the right values from the database and some of them I need to know how to extract from the specific component but it's not that hard either.

### Day 66: July 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the Java project and I also worked on some FCC challenges. I'm learning about using get and use functions in Express. In the java project I worked on the GUIs for a bit.

**Thoughts**: I can't wait for all of this to be over I feel so overwhelmed and I just want to chill out for a bit. My eating poorly and my sleep schedules is almost non-existent but it's the final weeks. Fighting!!

### Day 67: July 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the Java project and I also worked on some FCC challenges. It's been a bit same old same old but It's good since I'm so tired and I had almost no sleep.

**Thoughts**: I NEED A BREAK, not from coding but from my classes and this school environment. I've burned out!!!!!!!!

### Day 68: July 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked more on the Java project. This project's gonna be big one because I need to finish the part of registering Docentes, Publicacao, Veiculos and so on in the database but I intended at least at first to do the all of the CRUD but I can see that this will take me a while so I might just do the CR part haha. It's been interesting because I've been learning a lot about how to save and retrieve data and it's not as trivial as I was expecting especially when it comes to saving Objects (or parts of). I've been working on FCC challenges as well but they are not as good to be honest I think the quality is not that great but I love the platform in general, this last challenges and the last certification for that matter, has been very superficial and I had the need to complement a lot so that I could understand the concepts.

**Thoughts**: I've putting it off all day but I am glad I can still "force myself" to do it. I've struggling with procrastination but when I get to do the thing it's never that bad. Don't get me wrong I do the things I need but I still need to have better time management I need to start changing some of my behaviors so I can be more productive.

---

### Day 69: July 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the SistemaPPGI project (Java), I implemented addListarQualificacao which is function that returns a list of Qualificacoes from the database. Also did some FCC challenges.

**Thoughts**: Working on project shines the lights on where you might be lacking. I need to learn a lot about databases and how to design them. I've been realising the pattern of lacking of designing skills so I really know where I should be focusing my efforts when I'm on vacation.

### Day 70: July 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on some FCC challenges. I completed the Basic Node and Express section. It was very basic I was expecting to learn more routes and post and http request and stuff but it focused a lot on setting up the routes and understanding how to retrieve data. I also worked on the Java project.

**Thoughts**:  I like when do a lot of FCC because often the challenges are very bite-sized and I can learn what is inteded but at the same time I feel that when it comes to a complex topic they don't do it justice and leave me hanging I don't know if it's only me but I don't think so.

### Day 71: July 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on the MongoDB and Mongoose section on FCC. I only finished the first challenge because I spent a lot of time figuring out and setting up MongoDB. I also worked a bit on the Java project. 

**Thoughts**:  I have some wonderful news but I'm only gonna share once I sort everything and I can talk about more about it. One thing I can say is that databases are going to become my close friends lol. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/SistemaCredenciamentoPPGI/commit/2540efc2f4d096ea12f8d4e5c06549e946b1f42c)

---

### Day 72: July 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the MongoDB and Mongoose section again. I solved a challenge that required me to create a Person model. It was easy but the challenges are not very helpful I read the documentation but what really helped to learn was another page I found googling. I also worked on the Java project, I changed the button names of the TelaPrincipal form and removed some autogenerated main functions.

**Thoughts**: Very tiresome to be studying for a big exam and having to worry about coding for an hour. It was a very intense day I focused lot on studying for this exam.

### Day 73: July 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked  on some menial tasks on my Java project. I have yet to decide what I am gonna do next, for the time being I'm working on the GUIs again. I also worked a FCC challenge about creating and saving a Record Model.

**Thoughts**: I'm officially on vacation with a bittersweet taste more on that another time. I will take this few days I have to truly enjoy and rest because it's a tough couple of months in so many ways.. What matters is that I'm on vacation and I can focus more on what is important to me.

### Day 74: July 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the Java project. I created and implemented listarRegras and started commenting the code. I aslo worked on a FCC challenge. I'm taking my time with these challenges I think this certification is very shallow and I think the name is a bit misleading but it's FCC so I like their intention.

**Thoughts**: I'm in my hometown and I feel so tired of the traveling. It's not far but it was a long day. I'll be here for a coulple of days, it's good to see family and close friends.

### Day 75: July 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on some FCC challenges. I've been learning about MongoDB and Mongoose. I think I need to complement my learning with another resource. Youtube? Books? Udemy? I also worked on the Java project. I don't know how long I'll be working on this project. I need to design the database better to fit the project.

**Thoughts**: I've spend the day with one of my best friends in the world and it was so refreshing I needed to see her and talk to her I feel bad that I don't that as often as I should. We played xbox and talked about everything I loved it.

### Day 76: July 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on some FCC challenges. I finished the MongoDB and Mongoose section so this means now I'll be working on this certification projects. The challenges in general was fun but it was very basic and I was hoping for more depth. I know FCC is only the first step when you want to become a full stack, they only give you the path but you have to be willing to look for more.

**Thoughts**:  I'm pretty sure that the projects are going to take me almost 10 times it took me to complete the challenges. I hope they don't focus as much on the MongoDB section because it was, in a few words, sloppy. I know they intend you to read the docs and google stuff but it was too basic and I think what the projects are going to require you to do it's gonna take you a lot of time.

### Day 77: July 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I watched videos about Database Design because I want to better my design skills and it will come in handy soon. I finished the Request Header Parser Microservice. Being honest these two project were very basic I want something more challenging. Finishing this certification I intend to get serious in a Udemy course.

**Thoughts**: I decided to stay another day in my hometown and it's been a very productive day I've been enjoying time with family and coding. Learning more about database has been fun.

### Day 78: July 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the URL shortner project from FCC and I mostly googled stuff and imported (required) librararies and created the necessary routes. I also wrote more comments in my Java project.

**Thoughts**: I traveled back to Vitoria and it was so tiring I need to go to sleep very soon. I intend to comment all of my Java project. The Java project is far from done but I won't be working on that anymore I need to shift my focus on learning more about databases and SQL technologies. I believe that bettering my database design skills and my database knowledge in general will make me a better developer and then I can get back to old project with a fresh perspective.

### Day 79: July 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I created some GUIs in my Java project. I watched some SQL Server tutorial(SQL in an hour video). I'm very tired of my first day but I'm very happy that I officially started I'm very excited for what is coming next.

**Thoughts**: Today was my first day on my internship and I'm very tired I intend to write about my first week because I want to document all of my intership from day 1. I want to become better at SQL so I will be watching a lot of tutorials and maybe see how can I create a mini project so I can get better.

### Day 80: July 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I watched the rest of the SQL Basics. It was an overview about basic queries using SQL server. I've learned about INNER JOIN and I think this will be helpful on my Java project. I also worked on the URL Shortener Microservice project.

**Thoughts**: I think the hardest part about working with database is the design aspect of it. I know there are a lot of problems that a inherit by using databases but I'm not at this level yet I have a very basic knowledge so this is the first apparent one. I know that is a problem regardless of the technology.

### Day 81: July 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started implementing a new approach to the URL Shortner Microservice project (FCC). I also watched some SQL Server Tutorials (Thanks Caleb).

**Thoughts**: I think now I get what the URL Shortener Really is. I got a rough idea and I was not really sure what I needed to do or how MongoDB would get in game. I hope that now I can make more progress because this one is hader than the last two and love it. I don't understand myself I feel very insecure about my habilities when I face something hard but I hate when things are too easy or simple. I think I just need to get something challeging enough for me to be satisfied. (I'm in a adjusting process)

### Day 82: July 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the URL Shortener project on freeCodeCamp. I mainly worked on fixing a bug and creating the Short Model. I also watched some SQL Server Tutorial. The tutorials are very basic but I think it's important to cover everything since I need to be familiar with it.

**Thoughts**: Back-end is more fun than front-end one and I'm just scratching the surface. I'm wondering how can I create projects in SQL Server. I know I'll be coding a lot in SQL but I want to be working on my own side projects and I want them to be in SQL Server.

### Day 83: July 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked more on the URL Shortener project on FCC, I added the saving and finding part of the db but it's not working the way it should. I don't know how to solve it yet but tomorrow I will. I watched a bunch of tutorials on SQL Server and I starting taking notes to make easier that reviewing process.

**Thoughts**: I wish my weekend were more productive but I'm happy with what I could accomplish. Tomorrow is gonna be a learning day and I'm very excited to start learning at work. It still feels weird to say boss and work but I'll get used to.

### Day 84: July 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I tried working with the db part of the URL Shortener but with not much success. It's not saving in the db but it seems not to be even creating the model right. I spent a lot of time trying to tests and rewrite but it didn't work better luck to me tomorrow. I also watched some SQL Server tutorials that is being all about database design but it's cool for me because this is the part the I'm most interested in.

**Thoughts**: Working for 6 hours straight is not easy and I think it'll take time for me to get used to, don't get me wrong I've been enjoying and today was the best day so far because I finally worked on something that will impact in the project. I'm a bit worried about the next semester because I already can see that it will be hard but I hope I come out stronger and my time management skills become sharper. I have good time management skills I think I lack in learning how to prioritize sometimes. I'll do better and I will get better. You can do it Kaio!!!!

### Day 85: July 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the URL Shortener project. I still don't know how to solve this and I will try watching some tutorials about it. Apparently is saving into the db but I can't find it so it's not saving or there's a problem with my model. I watched some SQL tutorials and took notes on it. 

**Thoughts**: It's been a good day, I still have to get used to my days being short. lol. I thought I would've solved the mongodb issue by today but I need to learn more about it before moving on.

### Day 86: July 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on the URL Shortener project (FCC) and made huge progress. It's redirecting to the right page and I fixed the issue with the DB. I took me a bit but I'm so glad I continued.

**Thoughts**: Today I could've coded more but now I see that I always sleep when I have the opportunity to so I did that early in the eveving. I think I'm adjusting well with the internship and everything is going smoothly.

### Day 87: August 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on the URL Shotener project (FCC) and now it's not saving the same url twice. Before saving is checking if it's already in the database and it's displaying for the user. It's simple but it took me a bit, I was reving problem with checking null.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling refreshed with the possibilities and I've been learning a lot about databases lately. It's very cool to be part of something different and innovative.

### Day 88: August 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Today I worked on the URL Shortener project (FCC), I mainly made some verifications and  wrote some comments to guide me to write the solutions I want to implement. 

**Thoughts**: I must learn to prioritize and I should be more willing to take actions. I need to become better in delphi to solve a particular solution and it's cool and scary at the same time.

### Day 89: August 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the URL Shortener project (FCC). I worked on some issues that I had for the past few days with the db.  Now I have two more left to complete this certification. 

**Thoughts**: It's a very good feeling when you finish a project. You learn a lot about a subject and it's very rewarding solving all of the problems you come across and it's even better when you come up with sophisticated solutions to the problem at hand.

### Day 90: August 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I started working on the Exercise Tracker project (FCC). I started to set up the MongoDB and started working on the routes. Also watched some SQL tutorials.

**Thoughts**: It's been a very chill day and it was very good to start another project.

### Day 91: August 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the Exercise Tracker application (FCC). I focused on the routes and creating the mongoose schema. I also watched some Delphi tutorials.

**Thoughts**: Whenever I go to my internship early in the morning I have a very unproductive day so I will try to change that. Today I procrastinated a lot but I got the job done.

### Day 92: August 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Exercise Tracker project (FCC). Focused on the route about creating a new user and checking the conditions to not have duplicates and to use valid names. I also watched SQL tutorials. 

**Thoughts**: I'm very energised and worried for what's cominng. I have a tough semester coming but I'm sure I'll do my best and everything is gonna be fine. I've been learning so much about people and about myself I hope I become better at interacting with human beings in the process.

### Day 93: August 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the Exercise Tracker project (FCC). I focused on another route /exercise/add. It's similar to the other one but I have to update an existing model and then show it in a json format.

**Thoughts**: I haven't been the best coder lately but I've been making consistent progress. JavaScript is so cool and versitile but I can't wait to discover what I can do with Java and its frameworks. I'm a sucker for Java I know. lol
