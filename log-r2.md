# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 2) 


### Day 1: May 07, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finally started to get serious about my React App. I love how everything is in this closed modules and 
you can add stuff to it. So exciting.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I decided to go for another round I know how much programming in general means to me and this 
is another change to ingrain this habit.

### Day 2: May 08, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the functionality on the Random Quote Machine project. I'm very happy that I was able to write my first React App from scratch. I'll be working on the styling for a bit.

**Thoughts**: Very fulfilling to be working on projects again. I want to finish the the Front End Libraries Certification in the next few weeks. It's been crazy how much is in my plate but I know coding is a passion worth sacrificing time. I see more like an investment in my carrer and in my sanity.

### Day 3: May 09, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the Random Quote Machine project on FCC. 

**Thoughts**: I'm glad with the final look of the project. It's a very simple project but I was able to use a lot of React concepts I've been learning so far.

### Day 4: May 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've started the Markdown Previewer project on FCC. I'll be using React in all of my FCC projects or At least I'm gonna try to do it. I also sort of refactor the Random Quote Machine code to match the code pen one so it opens on the browser.

**Thoughts**: The React syntax is coming to me slowly. I felt that I didn't know how to start a project and now I'm feeling confident tha the basic syntax is sinking in.
