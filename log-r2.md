# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 2) 


### Day 1: May 07, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finally started to get serious about my React App. I love how everything is in this closed modules and 
you can add stuff to it. So exciting.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I decided to go for another round I know how much programming in general means to me and this 
is another change to ingrain this habit.

### Day 2: May 08, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the functionality on the Random Quote Machine project. I'm very happy that I was able to write my first React App from scratch. I'll be working on the styling for a bit.

**Thoughts**: Very fulfilling to be working on projects again. I want to finish the the Front End Libraries Certification in the next few weeks. It's been crazy how much is in my plate but I know coding is a passion worth sacrificing time. I see more like an investment in my carrer and in my sanity.

### Day 3: May 09, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the Random Quote Machine project on FCC. 

**Thoughts**: I'm glad with the final look of the project. It's a very simple project but I was able to use a lot of React concepts I've been learning so far.

### Day 4: May 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've started the Markdown Previewer project on FCC. I'll be using React in all of my FCC projects or At least I'm gonna try to do it. I also sort of refactor the Random Quote Machine code to match the code pen one so it opens on the browser.

**Thoughts**: The React syntax is coming to me slowly. I felt that I didn't know how to start a project and now I'm feeling confident tha the basic syntax is sinking in.

### Day 5: May 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've continued working on the Markdown Previewer. I spent a lot of time reading documentation and tutorials about the passing data between sibling components. 

**Thoughts**: The more I use React the more I get more impressed and see how beautiful it is. I want to become an awesome React developer. I'll learn Angular though and I think they follow some principles I have to look this up. I have so many I ideas I want to build the game store from the last module in php. I want to become proficient in php as well since I'm already learning it on my IT techinician course (don't know how to translate it better lol).

### Day 6: May 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've continued working on the Markdown Previewer. I'm not sure how to use the Marked.js in my project. I know it is easier than to parse the markdown myself. Doing project we're able to see a lot of gaps in our knowlegde and I feel great that I making this gap smaller. We face hardship but we come out stronger!

**Thoughts**: This project is being more intersting because I get to read documentation from a JS library that I have no idea how it works. I hope that I become a more skilled developer in the way. I can't believe it's been 6 days already and I'm so glad I didn't stop. I still have so much to learn and master that I don't get to not work towards my dreams. I know it sounds bad but I mean in the best way possible.
