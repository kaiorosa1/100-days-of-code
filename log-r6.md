# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 6) 



### Day 1: June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Angular course. I worked on section 3 which was about creating the course project and setting up the components, models and installing some dependencies.

**Thoughts**: I started thinking about this new round but I still don't have a concrete plan. I want to have a weekly plan but I will start that soon. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit Link](https://github.com/kaiorosa1/angular-the-complete-guide-2020/commit/802c2801284289cea02b7fdac626a71ce292673d)
