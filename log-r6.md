### Day 81: August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I switched to another Spring Framework course now and spend most of my time installing tomcat and configuring it to work with Eclipse. Now I will be able to finally start learning, next section is about Spring Inversion of Control.

**Thoughts**: I decided to buy another Spring course because I was not very happy with the one I was taking and it turns out the new one is way better and I will probably continue with it. Saturday is a great day to just test things because I know I still have one more day to relax or to even work on other personal projects.

### Day 62: August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked section 14. I did some TDD exercises. TDD is a very good way to start writing clean code but at the same time it's very counter intuitive to thing of code like that for me personally.

---

### Day 57: August 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished section 12. I could see with examples how to write unit tests, specifically testing objects, strings, and even exceptions!

**Thoughts**: It's another mindset that you must have when writing those unit test because you don't want to be very specific but you also don't want to be so general. It's an ability of itself to be able to write good tests. I know that there are people who work with writing tests and there are TDD and everything it seems like a good career path.

**Thoughts**: I expect the first few sections to be more of a review of everything I already know and then we gonna get to the new meaty concepts in Node. I'm feeling very good about the decison of coding for 2 hours a day since I feel that there are so much I want to cover so I need to spend more time coding.

### Day 16: June 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished all the lectures on section 2 and done all of the homework problem set. It was quite chill but some of the exercises were harder than I expected. 

**Thoughts**: My thoughts on Haskell remain being a hard language overall and I can let the really smart people use them for something great. I will probably be dealing with average people's problem. That is my exact thought on Assembly hahah. But in the case of Haskell I want to be able to learn all of the functional aspect and condition myself to think in a more funcitonal way because I know it's hella useful and it seems fun (for now).
