### Day 1: June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Angular course. I worked on section 3 which was about creating the course project and setting up the components, models and installing some dependencies.

**Thoughts**: I started thinking about this new round but I still don't have a concrete plan. I want to have a weekly plan but I will start that soon.
